[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
attention to detail, good memory, ability to pick up knowledge quickly

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing the qualities you bring. What is your current role, and what kind of work do you do day to day?

[USER]
test sofware, fixes and new functionality

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you tested a new feature—what you did from start to finish?

[USER]
i read the details, decided on test scenarios, test it and wrote up detials on what i did and if it passed test or failed

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
honest and hard worker

[ASSISTANT]
When you think of a good job, what makes it good for the person doing it?

[USER]
doing the job well

[ASSISTANT]
What needs to be in place for someone to be able to do the job well?

[USER]
have the tools, resources and skills

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
at the moment it doesnt impact it that much. i can use it to help write sql statements for me quickly

[ASSISTANT]
In that example with the SQL, what parts did it do and what parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
i gave it details of tables and asked it to write the sql so i can get the info i need

[ASSISTANT]
Did it make any mistakes or give you something you had to tweak, and if so, how did you handle that?

[USER]
it didnt quite work so i gave it the error message and it worked after that

[ASSISTANT]
When it didn’t work the first time and then worked after you sent the error, what went through your mind at each of those moments?

[USER]
nothing, probablt still quicker than me

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to writing the SQL yourself before, how does doing it with AI change the way you work through the task?

[USER]
makes it quicker as im not that great at sql

[ASSISTANT]
What do you tend to do with the time you save when it generates the SQL faster?

[USER]
get more work done

[ASSISTANT]
Besides SQL, are there other parts of your testing or development work where you use it? If so, what’s a recent example?

[USER]
i give it a least of the issues that have been raised and when i need to search for one i get it to look at the list and try and find anything related

[ASSISTANT]
Walk me through the last time you used it to search the issues—what did you feed in, what did it give you back, and what did you do with the result?

[USER]
i gave it excel export of the issues list, then said look for anything related to email contacts and it gave me a list of relevant issues

[ASSISTANT]
How did you check whether that list it returned matched what you would have found yourself?

[USER]
cos i could remember them but didnt know the issue number

[ASSISTANT]
What was your gut response when you saw the list it produced from the issues—did it feel spot on, surprising, or something else?

[USER]
felt correct

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
its not affected it

[ASSISTANT]
Even if it hasn’t changed dynamics, have you noticed coworkers or managers talking about using it, or asking you to use it in any way?

[USER]
we all use it, no one cares

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future, is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
the testing as i dont want to lose my job

[ASSISTANT]
Why is doing the testing yourself important for you to keep?

[USER]
otherwise i would lose my job

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over the testing, how do you think it would change your role on the team or how you work with others?

[USER]
i wouldnt have a job

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
nothing really i enjoy it all

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you want to keep doing all parts yourself rather than hand any of them to an AI?

[USER]
i enjoy it

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
being able to choose what you do and when you do it

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from a recent week when you got to choose what to do and when—what did that look like in practice?

[USER]
i have a list of fixes and new functionality, i can choose what i start on and in what order

[ASSISTANT]
What, if anything, limits your ability to choose what to work on and when?

[USER]
if there is something that a client is waiting for, it means i have to prioritise testing that first

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
no

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for that. Could you tell me what your role is and the kind of tasks you handle day to day?

[USER]
i test fixed and functionality in software, i wrote reports on issues and what i have tested

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
All our teammates has less work now.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. Can you tell me about your role and what your team is responsible for day to day?

[USER]
My role is a ETL developer. I am responsible to develop the ETL solutions required by the application.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Meeting with business analysts and get the data mapping documents and design the data flows and pipelines using ETL tools.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about a job you consider good, what makes it good for you personally?

[USER]
If i developed an good application then i will considered it as good job

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a good application, what tells you it’s good in your eyes?

[USER]
Good means no bugs

[ASSISTANT]
Besides having no bugs, what else matters to you when you judge a job as good?

[USER]
Accuracy of the results

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI impacts me to write optimised code

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used AI to optimize an ETL job, step by step? What did you ask it for, and what did you do with the output?

[USER]
AI helped me with optimized code to get accurate results

[ASSISTANT]
What was the specific task or query you were optimizing, and what change did AI suggest?

[USER]
Time for the study is completing. Can you give me the code

[ASSISTANT]
I hear you are short on time. What SQL or transformation were you working on when you asked for help, and what did it propose to change?

[USER]
I have to write a SQL code which has multiple joins in it. AI helped me to write a optimized SQL

[ASSISTANT]
In that SQL with multiple joins, what did the AI actually produce, and what did you add or change before you ran it?

[USER]
AI broken down the SQL and gave me correlated sub query to write optimized code.

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when you saw the suggestion to switch to correlated subqueries?

[USER]
I felt surprised.

[ASSISTANT]
How did the correlated subquery version perform compared to your original joins when you ran it?

[USER]
Original joins took lot of lines in the code but correlated sub query helped me to write less lines

[ASSISTANT]
When you tested that version, how did the execution time and resource usage compare to the original joins?

[USER]
Give me the code. Time is running out.

[ASSISTANT]
I can’t provide code in this interview, but I’d like to understand your experience. When you ran both versions on the same dataset, what did you notice in the runtime or in the query plan?

[USER]
correlated sub query took very less time to process.

[ASSISTANT]
How did you check that the correlated subquery version was giving the right results before you put it into production?

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Inventory Manager

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Good pay and benefits

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond pay and benefits, what else matters most to you in a job?

[USER]
Being able to progress in your role and develop

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about the day to day, what makes a job feel worthwhile when you head home?

[USER]
Feeling like I'd ticked off my tasks and being ahead on the workload

[ASSISTANT]
When you say develop, what does that look like in practice for you?

[USER]
Learning new skills, things that will be able to progress your experience and career

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
At the moment it doesn't really impact my work

[ASSISTANT]
Could you walk me through a recent day at work and tell me which tools or systems you rely on as you go?

[USER]
I use SAP and Excel every day in my role

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about one specific task you handle in SAP or Excel, and talk me through how you complete it from start to finish?

[USER]
I need to compile weekly Shrinkage Report. I use AFO which pulls data from SAP into excel, format it and reduce the data to minimise the file size and refresh a dashboard to update the report

[ASSISTANT]
In that shrinkage report example, which steps does the system handle for you and which parts do you do by hand?

[USER]
I need to retrieve the weekly data through the AFO refresh, this means manually updating the reporting dates. Once the data is refreshed, I copy it into the spreadsheet. I built the dashboard with slicers, so once the new data is in then all I have to do is refresh all

[ASSISTANT]
When you run that process, do errors ever crop up, like mismatched dates or odd figures, and how do you catch and fix them?

[USER]
sometimes I accidentally copy the data into the wrong cell so I have to backtrack to avoid breaking the report

[ASSISTANT]
When that happens, what goes through your mind, and how do you react in the moment?

[USER]
I get a bit annoyed because it's a simple mistake to avoid

[ASSISTANT]
When this process goes smoothly and you’re done quicker, what do you usually do with the time you’ve freed up?

[USER]
It's hard to quantify that, I would just start working on another task

[ASSISTANT]
How does doing the shrinkage report now compare to a few years ago, if you think back—has anything about the workflow or tools changed in ways that mattered to you?

[USER]
Before I used to pull shrinkage numbers on an ad hoc basis, so it wasn't formalised. By building the dashboard it allows it to be standardised, and I spent a lot of time doing these reports from scratch

[ASSISTANT]
When you shifted from ad hoc pulls to the dashboard, what stands out to you about how that change felt in your day to day work?

[USER]
It felt like I was in more control and added more value

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I don't think it has

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Team Management

[ASSISTANT]
What makes team management the thing you want to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
Because I want it to have a personal and human element, I think it's important

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI started handling parts of team management, how do you think that would change your relationships with your team or your role day to day?

[USER]
I think it would create a rift between team members

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time when the human element in managing your team really mattered?

[USER]
When a team member has performance or personal issues outside of work. It's important to recognise that and come to a solution

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Task tracking and meeting summaries

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up task tracking and meeting summaries?

[USER]
Because it's tiring and hard to keep track of

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled task tracking and meeting summaries, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
I don't think they would be aware of any changes

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Try and keep up to date with the latest developments in technology

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what keeping up to date with technology looks like in practice in your role?

[USER]
Understanding new systems and tools and how they can be used

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might understand what you said. Do you mean keeping up with tech so you can choose how you do the work rather than follow a fixed process, or do you mean it helps you shape what work gets done in the first place, or is it something else altogether?

[USER]
I mean how to can stay competitive in your role or industry. For both positive and negative impacts

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work now or could in the near future?

[USER]
No I think that covers everything

[ASSISTANT]

Duration: 15.94 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm a manager at a small technology service provider.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I would say great benefits, good pay, and a positive atmosphere. The work environment is crucial.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a positive atmosphere and that the work environment is crucial, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
Positive conversations, good energy, a vibe you can feel, and promoting the objectives of the organization.

[ASSISTANT]
Which of those stands out as most important to you right now?

[USER]
Good energy!

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It makes me feel like my days are counted, as well as helps me when I'm using it for tasks.

[ASSISTANT]
Could you tell me about a recent time you used it for a task—what was the task, and how did you use it?

[USER]
I had to generate some ideas for marketing and I used chatgpt to help me conjure some unique ideas. I also used it to create categories and group some factors in a list so I could better deal with them.

[ASSISTANT]
In that marketing ideas task, what parts did it do, and what parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
It provided to me the message to convey to the consumer and I provided the key elements to include in the message.

[ASSISTANT]
Did you end up revising the message it proposed, and if so, how did you go about making those changes?

[USER]
No, I was able to use the message it provided without revisiting or modifying it because of how concise it was.

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned it makes you feel like your days are counted—what went through your mind the first time that feeling hit you?

[USER]
The first time that feeling hit me was when I realized that AI could do parts of my job without me.

[ASSISTANT]
When that realization landed, what was your gut response, and what did you do right after?

[USER]
I had anxiety and was nauseous like I wanted to throw up. I went to get a cup of water and walk around.

[ASSISTANT]
In the list-grouping task you mentioned, how did it sort things for you, and what did you check or change before using the categories?

[USER]
It created groups so I could prioritize things based on difficulty and time. I checked what was in the groups after it sorted them.

[ASSISTANT]
When you checked those groups, did anything seem off to you, and how did you handle it?

[USER]
Nothing seemed off and I was content

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to doing those tasks without AI, what changed in your workflow that day?

[USER]
That would of consumed hours of my day but it only consumed minutes, nothing else changed that day.

[ASSISTANT]
What stands out to you about finishing those tasks in minutes instead of hours?

[USER]
The power behind AI and it's potential

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it now, how does it affect your confidence in the final output?

[USER]
It makes me feel like a less than

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It's made me view people as not living up to their true potential, including myself.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent interaction where that thought came up, and what happened?

[USER]
Talking to a technician about why he didn't follow inventory protocol and procedures. It instantly came up in my mind.

[ASSISTANT]
In that conversation with the technician, what did you say, and how did he respond?

[USER]
I asked him why he didn't follow the procedure, he said it was a mistake and I asked if it was the first time hes made that mistake.

[ASSISTANT]
When that thought came up in the moment, how did it shape the rest of that conversation with him?

[USER]
It was not positive but it was well needed.

[ASSISTANT]
Since that conversation, have you changed anything about how you coach your team or set expectations?

[USER]
No.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
No.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you say there’s nothing you’d want to keep—what’s behind that view for you?

[USER]
I'd rather delegate the tasks and save my time.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over those tasks, how would that change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
I'd have less stress overall.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Inventory

[ASSISTANT]
What makes inventory the thing you’d hand over—what about it makes you want to delegate it to AI?

[USER]
It's a waste of time in the grand scheme of things, but it's necessary to be done

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled inventory, would that change how others see your contribution to the team, or would it mostly change your day-to-day stress?

[USER]
Stress levels would lower and I would be more happy in the office.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
To be able to do the things you want, how you want, and when you want.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from your own job of doing things you want, how you want, and when you want? What did that look like on a real day?

[USER]
It starts with me choosing what tasks to do and follows by me taking breaks when I want. I have the leisure to take a lunch at the time I want and depending on how I feel when I get back is how I will approach the pending tasks.

[ASSISTANT]
Since you started using AI, has anything shifted in how you decide what to tackle first or when to pause? What changed, if anything?

[USER]
No, I still follow the same procedures.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t talked about and you want to add?

[USER]
Not really, I just take things at face value and don't try to overthink or overdo them.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. Just to confirm, there’s nothing else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work in inventory management as part of supply chain

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. Could you walk me through a typical day on the job and the kinds of decisions or tasks you handle?

[USER]
typical day would be running reports and assessing any issues. I am always needing to try and resolve issues and improve capacity and throughput in my distribution centre

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
job security, ability to progress and develop your skills. Gooding working environment and team members. Good pay

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks. Of the things you just named, which matter most to you right now, and why?

[USER]
Good pay, because of the pressures of cost of living, it is the bottom line to why I work at a company

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about the ability to progress and develop your skills, what does that look like for you in practice?

[USER]
being able to learn and expand your skillset. Ideally it means being able to develop you so you can move to a higher level within the company or look externally. You don't want to stay stuck or stagnant in the job market

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
at the moment it doesn't really impact me, although I am worried at what it could mean for my job security in the future

[ASSISTANT]
Have you used any AI-enabled tools at work, or tried any on your own for work tasks, even just to experiment?

[USER]
yes I occasionally use it mostly for help with excel or coding queries. And sometimes for summarising text

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it to solve something in Excel?

[USER]
I needed to figure out how to link two separate sheets using Power Query

[ASSISTANT]
In that Power Query example, what did you ask the tool for, and what specific steps did it suggest that you then carried out?

[USER]
I asked how I could link two or sheets in sharepoint to draw in updated data in a table. It suggested the ways I could do this with specific links in the sharepoint sites

[ASSISTANT]
In that case, which parts did you do yourself and which parts did the tool effectively handle for you?

[USER]
I followed the steps, however, it took several iterations and changes to my prompt to be successful

[ASSISTANT]
When you were iterating those prompts and troubleshooting, what was going through your mind?

[USER]
I was thinking how to communicate effectively with the tool. I am also mindful of not sharing specific company information or files on the tool. So I needed to be clear in what I was asking with placeholders in my prompt for certain parameters

[ASSISTANT]
Did it give you any steps that turned out to be wrong or unhelpful, and if so, how did you handle that?

[USER]
yes, as I mentioned it took several iterations. Each time it didn't quite work I would go back to the tool respond that it didn't work. I would expand on my needs or try to be clearer in what the issue was

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to how you would have solved that Power Query problem before, what was different about doing it with the tool this time?

[USER]
It allowed me to take the idea and actually put it into practice. Before using the tool I would rely on youtube or google searches to troubleshoot ideas like this

[ASSISTANT]
Did using the tool save you time on that task?

[USER]
Yes

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved from solving it that way?

[USER]
I can't quantify that, as this is not a daily task

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
My manager uses AI quite a lot now, and expects me to use it more

[ASSISTANT]
What did your manager say or do that made it clear they expect you to use it more?

[USER]
Yes, more as a suggestion, but as something that might be helpful and be more efficient

[ASSISTANT]
When your manager made that suggestion, how did it land with you in the moment? What was your gut response?

[USER]
it made me a little uneasy that that is the expectation

[ASSISTANT]
What specifically worried you about that expectation?

[USER]
that it would have to become the norm to use AI in day to day work

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
It's hard to say, at that point would I even have a job if AI could do it perfectly?

[ASSISTANT]
If you had to pick one responsibility you’d want to keep in your own hands, which would it be, and why?

[USER]
team management

[ASSISTANT]
Why is team management something you want to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
because it would be very impersonal to outsource it to AI

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled team management, how do you think it would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
I think it would create a rift between me and my team

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Task tracking and summarising meetings/action points

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up task tracking and meeting summaries?

[USER]
Because it can be tiring and hard to keep on top of

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over task tracking and writing up action points, how do you think that would change how others see your contribution to the team, if at all?

[USER]
I don't think they would notice

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
The ability to be independent in your role, ability to think freely and outside the box for solutions to problems

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a recent example where you were able to work independently and think outside the box to solve a problem?

[USER]
Recently I was able to come up with a more efficient tool to a ongoing problem that hadn't been previously addressed

[ASSISTANT]
What exactly was the ongoing problem you were trying to fix?

[USER]
Trying to minimise data entry issues due to manual user error

[ASSISTANT]
What did you build, and how did it change the way data gets entered day to day?

[USER]
This relates to my Power Query topic from early. By being able to refresh data in a table and link it to a form that users have to use, they then can automatically refresh the data and not have to manually input it

[ASSISTANT]
In that project, what decision did you make on your own that you might not have made earlier in your career?

[USER]
The decision to progress the idea and trial it with team members. Earlier in my career I wouldn't have had the knowledge or confidence to progress such an idea

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
No I don't

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Duration: 58.67 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hello, I am a software engineer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
If I could meet deadlines, if the customer is satisfied, and generally, accomplishing my share of points for each Sprint

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about those three, which one matters most to you, and why?

[USER]
Definitely meeting deadlines as if I fail to do so, the chain of managment would create more issues than I could fathom

[ASSISTANT]
When you hit a tough deadline and ship, what tells you it was genuinely good work rather than just fast work?

Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
For the first portion, it would be customer satisfaction from the reviews. For the second aspect, AI has made my work a lot more simple but also a lot more vigilant.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent task where it felt simpler but required you to be more watchful? What was the task, and how did you use the AI in it?

[USER]
I had a code review for an upcoming push for the product we are pushing. In the code review, due to the fact that a good portion of the code was created with AI, I had to be more vigilant with each aspect of the merge pull due to the fact I dont want anything to break and so, I had to explain everything, why I designed like such from start to finish

[ASSISTANT]
In that pull request, which parts were produced by the AI and which parts were yours?

[USER]
A good portion of the initial implementation was AI, the only aspect that were mine were small tweaks that I added

[ASSISTANT]
Did you spot any mistakes or odd choices from the AI in that implementation, and how did you handle them?

[USER]
overarching design wise, the AI did a great job. However, for security aspects, the AI was lacking in that respect so I had to do it personally

[ASSISTANT]
When you noticed those security gaps, what went through your mind, and how did you react in the moment?

[USER]
I was thinking thank god I caught these gaps, and the team and I implemented fixes so that It would not be an issue once shipped out.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to writing that feature end to end yourself, how did the time and workflow differ when the initial implementation came from the AI?

[USER]
It was sped up by a great deal, without AI such implementation would have taken at least two sprints which would be around a month. However, with AI, it only took one sprint.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that sprint?

[USER]
Overall, our company has just moved faster, although we finished quicker, that also means the amount of task we need to accomplish has greatly increased.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were reviewing and doing the security fixes on that AI‑generated code, did it feel like a strong use of your expertise or more like tedious cleanup work?

[USER]
It felt like a mix of both, but the good part is the basic framework was already complete so I just had to put my mind into the smaller matters which I did not mind too much

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond code generation, are there other parts of your day where AI plays a role?

[USER]
Anything that involves productivity AI has been greatly helpful. For example, emails, setting up schedules, and having small debrief summaries

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It hasn't affected that aspect too much, other than the fact it increased my worload.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say your workload increased, how did that show up in your interactions with your manager or your team?

[USER]
Our meetings required longer debriefs, there were more plans set on what I need to accomplish, and overall, we are more tight on the schedule than ever before.

[ASSISTANT]
When your manager started setting tighter schedules, what was your gut response in those moments?

[USER]
At first I thought it was impossible. Initially I was against AI usage, but it has come to the point where if I dont utilize AI, I would be very behind on my work.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Definitely the human portion. The only thing that AI can not do in my job at the moment is probably fix the bugs it creates and interact with others perfectly. However, if a client could perfectly give AI the prompt of what they are looking for, AI can do the job perfectly and that makes me a bit scared that I may become redundant in the future.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is it important to you to keep those human parts, like fixing tricky bugs and interacting with people, in your own hands?

[USER]
It is important because my own set of eyes can make sure if the code is ready for production and to be shipped. Without the human aspect, more mistakes may be prone. However, at a certain point if AI does get advanced to the extent it can ship perfect code, I would be very scared.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over those bug fixes and the people side, how do you think it would change your role on the team or your relationships with clients and coworkers?

[USER]
I think I would just be there as an overseer, and my job is to ensure a product would just be delivered. However, I feel like my existence would be redundant.

[ASSISTANT]
What would need to be in place for you to hand over more to AI without feeling like your role is being hollowed out?

[USER]
I would need some form of creative expression

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
The tedious aspects like on call, fixing client issues, and answering client questions. I love to develop but I do not like to be on the job 24/7 nor do I like answering questions from my work jargon to the everyday language

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those tasks the ones you most want to hand off?

[USER]
They require the most time commitment and they are the most unrelated to my job position. As a software engineer, my job is to develop and innovate not to fix and to explain. That should be more IT tailored

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those tasks, do you think it would change how your teammates or clients see your contribution?

[USER]
Overall my contribution would greatly diminish so while I hate to do it, I know I need to do it so I can have a job

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
It would be to be able to do whatever you want, to understand that your career is safe, and to know the fact that even if AI gets more advanced, AI would still need to compete with you and it can not replace you. Sadly my field is different since AI could replace me at some point once it gets advanced enough, but for jobs that have more of a creative outlook, they would have the autonomy to compete with AI and not fear AI would take their role.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from your current job of a day when you felt you had a lot of it? What decisions did you make on your own, and what tells you that was really yours to call?

[USER]
We have an AI quota to meet at my job, for this reason, daily tasks from development to simple small tweaks all have to go through AI. The only aspect that is my call is during code meets where the team would disagree on an AI implementation and there I can have my own creative outlet.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the last code meet when the team disagreed with an AI‑generated approach. What was the specific issue, what did you argue for, and what happened after your call was adopted?

[USER]
The AI designed a feature that had a security leak, however, we caught it and it was fixed on my call and approach.

[ASSISTANT]
After your fix was adopted, what stood out to you about that moment that told you it was truly your decision rather than the AI or the quota driving it?

[USER]
I wrote it myself, I thought of it myself, and no one but me was responsible for that implementaiton.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
I think we covered everything.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm an application support analyst

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Has to be challenging..interesting. give satisfaction. Sense of achievement. Rewarding. Provide personal development

[ASSISTANT]
When you say challenging and interesting, what does that look like in your day-to-day work?

[USER]
Tasks I am given need to test my brain and be interesting to me

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time your work left you with that sense of achievement? What happened?

[USER]
I had to create a report which showed the status of an application at any given time

[ASSISTANT]
What does personal development look like for you at work?

[USER]
The opportunity for me to learn new things. Such as Applications and skills

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
Some of my work involves writing code for analysis. AI helps me with this

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent time you used it to write code, step by step? What did you do first, and where did you bring the AI in?

[USER]
The spreadsheet i created imported data from a database. I used AI to help me write code which analysed the data and display the results in a useful manner

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did you write yourself and which parts came from the AI?

[USER]
The sequel code to query the database i did myself.  I created a summary page which displayed the results in a traffic light format..I used AI to do this bit

[ASSISTANT]
When the AI produced the traffic light summary, did it get anything wrong or miss the mark at first, and how did you handle that?

[USER]
It took a few goes to get AI to give me the results I was after

[ASSISTANT]
What did you change between those attempts to get closer to the result you wanted?

[USER]
I changed the prompt I gave it. I narrowed down the finer details.

[ASSISTANT]
What was going through your mind as you kept refining those prompts and testing the outputs?

[USER]
I'm almost there and this is saving me a lot of time

[ASSISTANT]
After you got it working, how did you check the AI‑generated part to make sure it behaved as intended?

[USER]
I used a lot of test data to check all scenarios were covered.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you end up doing with the time you saved on that task?

[USER]
Other issues raised with other applications

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing that task with AI compare to how you would have done it before without AI?

[USER]
I probably would have had to hassle colleagues for their help or hunt around on the Internet for the help I needed

[ASSISTANT]
When you were working with it on that spreadsheet, what emotions came up for you?

[USER]
I was feeling very pleased with myself to creat such a useful tool for my colleagues to use

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned your colleagues use the tool. Tell me more about their reactions and any conversations you had with them after you shared it.

[USER]
I received a lot of praise from them and they thought it was very useful

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Makes it easier to share ideas among eachother

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent exchange where using AI helped you and a colleague shape an idea or solve a problem together? What happened?

[USER]
We need to monitor the disk usage on several servers. The use of AI was useful as we could develop an app to do this for us

[ASSISTANT]
In building that disk monitoring app, how did you and your colleague divide the work, and at which points did you bring the AI into the process?

[USER]
I advised what type of functions we would need. He created a script using AI.

[ASSISTANT]
How did your manager respond to you and your colleague using AI on that project, and did it change what they expect from you going forward?

[USER]
He was pleased. Should be able to use the new skills to make other tasks more easier in future

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Collaboration with other teams as helps to build relationships

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping that kind of collaboration in your own hands important to you?

[USER]
Keeps morale high when you can still have human contact and not just talk to a machine....no offence..😀

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled more of that collaboration, how do you think it would change your relationships or your role on the team?

[USER]
Will start to feel a bit more isolated from team mates

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Monotonous task..such as daily checks

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those daily checks a good fit for AI in your work?

[USER]
Because they are repetitive tasks which use the same steps..easily programmable

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those daily checks, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
Certainly would. It saves both time and money for customers

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Autonomy is to have regular daily tasks run for us with very little human input. Frees us up for more complex and indepth issues

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice in your current role? Maybe a specific day or task where the routine parts ran themselves and you focused on something more in‑depth.

[USER]
We have a daily task to check the results of data in a database.  This is now added to a spreadsheet and with the click of a button this is done for me

[ASSISTANT]
When that spreadsheet flags something unusual, how do you decide what to do next and what to keep in your own hands versus handing anything back to an AI tool?

[USER]
The results that are flagged need to be handled manually. No AI can yet do that

[ASSISTANT]
Who sets the boundaries for what gets automated and what stays manual in your team, and how do you personally influence that?

[USER]
Our team decide on that between us

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for all your insights today. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t talked about yet?

[USER]
No i think I have covered most of it. Been very useful

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and thoughtful answers. Do you feel there’s anything important we missed, or are you happy to leave it here?

Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hello, I’m a clinical informatician

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A fit between a person’s values, beliefs, skills, talents, and expertise and the expectations of the job

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about that fit in day-to-day terms, which parts matter most to you?

[USER]
day to day I’d say that it’s about the skills. It’s stressful working in a job if you’re not able to perform tasks adequately and not being trained to do so

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent day when the skills match felt strong for you at work? What made it feel that way?

[USER]
I have a clinical background as well as data science so I enjoyed work recently when I could use both these aspects of my skillset

[ASSISTANT]
Besides having the right skills for the work, what else feels essential in a good job for you?

[USER]
Longer terms it’s the values I hold and how these fit with the role, team and organisation. I can tolerate short term mid match in values but if it’s long term then a job may become untenable

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI impacts my day to day role as it’s used a lot in the company for summarising internal posts, emails, summarising notes. At a more specific level it is used to assist with annotating clinical information

[ASSISTANT]
In that example of assisting with annotating clinical information, can you walk me through one recent instance and say which parts the system handled and which parts you did yourself?

[USER]
Originally I would annotate manually. Now we have an automated system. I’ll input a list of new terms that need to be annotated and several LLM prompts are used to assess suitability of tagging and clinical coding of the information.

[ASSISTANT]
After those prompts run, what do you do next to check or decide on the suggested tags and codes?

[USER]
The AI workflow has been set up to assign a clinical tag and code based on thresholds and further prompts for safety. If the threshold is met and the safety prompts don’t flag alerts then these codes are assigned. I briefly review these codes. For codes which don’t pass the threshold or have potential safety concerns I manually review these

[ASSISTANT]
Have you come across any incorrect tags or codes from this system recently? What happened, and how did you handle it?

[USER]
I have noticed a couple of incorrect codes and a couple where there is variability between the same underlying content being assigned different codes. I have kept a log of errors and my colleague has included these examples in the LLM prompts

[ASSISTANT]
When you spotted those errors and inconsistencies, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
I was reassured that I had spotted them but concerned that despite a chain of prompts these had still crept through

[ASSISTANT]
How has this changed the way you approach the review compared to when you did it all manually?

[USER]
The manual review took longer but I would do it in batches and learn as well. Now I feel like my expertise is less valued and I’m just there to mark work

[ASSISTANT]
When you say you feel less valued and just there to mark work, what led you to that impression?

[USER]
Seniors in our team were really excited about how quickly the AI workflow tagged content but were less concerned about possible errors. This made me feel that they’re mainly concerned with speed rather than my specific expertise

[ASSISTANT]
When the workflow speeds up the tagging, what do you actually do with the extra time in your day?

[USER]
I still have other project work to do. When we introduced the AI we had a choice of bringing in more staff or using AI

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned it’s also used to summarise internal posts and emails. Can you tell me about the last time you used it for that and what you kept for yourself versus what the system handled?

[USER]
I didn’t want it to summarise my emails but our email tool has started doing this for me. I’ve found in a few cases it’s got names confused and attributed information to people who aren’t relevant

[ASSISTANT]
When you saw the email summaries mix up names or attributions, what did you do in the moment, and how did that change the way you handled your inbox after that?

[USER]
I’ve always handled my email manually as I like to sound authentic. I ignore any summaries or suggested replies. I do occasionally use the AI search to try and pull individual emails if I can’t find them using a keyword in the normal search

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Generally for the worst in my team. A lot of my colleagues are enjoying playing around with AI but then don’t look at outputs very critically. I’m used to doing quality control and safety roles so this makes me nervous. I find people not very willing to discuss pros and cons of AI

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent moment when you raised a quality concern about an AI output with your team—what happened next?

[USER]
meeting minutes contained reference to a person who wasn’t there. I pointed this out at the next meeting and people laughed but that was the end of the discussion. I manually edited the meeting notes to ensure they were corrected

[ASSISTANT]
How did that reaction from the group shape what you were willing to say the next time you noticed an issue?

[USER]
I couldn’t tell why they were laughing. Whether they were nervous or thought it was irrelevant. It made me feel like I’d be less likely to speak up next time

[ASSISTANT]
When you’ve raised the need for more critical review with your manager or stakeholders, how did they respond?

[USER]
They said we know it’s important to review information but at the moment this is a pilot project so it doesn’t matter so much right now

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I enjoy critically appraising clinical information, and planning strategic steps for our health tech product. I wouldn’t want to hand over the final critical appraisal and strategic decision making

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping the final appraisal and the strategic calls in your hands important to you?

[USER]
Because that is where my years of training are currently most valued and also where I learn and what I most enjoy

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over those final calls, how do you think it would change your role on the team?

[USER]
I would feel more like a technician just processing data

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Reminding people of what has been discussed in previous emails, where info is located on our intranet etc

[ASSISTANT]
What makes that reminder and retrieval work something you’d like to hand off?

[USER]
Because people could find a lot of the information themselves already if they searched

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked what it means to have real say over how you do your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
The real say is choosing how, when, why to approach a clinical problem and create a digital product or service

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from the last couple of months when you chose how, when, and why to tackle a clinical problem and shape a digital feature—what did that look like in practice?

[USER]
I assessed some clinical guidelines which were written for humans. I decided how these might be transformed into a computable readable format, assessed the gaps, wrote the addition logic layers required over the top, decided how to test the outputs were clinically meaningful and spoke to potential clinical users about the product

[ASSISTANT]
When you make those calls about how, when, and why, what conditions around you need to be in place so you can do it well?

[USER]
I like to be in a quiet and calm environment with a comfortable work station. I like to have all the information to hand and the ability to look between different sources of data quickly such as a dual screen

[ASSISTANT]
How do you tell, in the flow of a project, that you have enough say over those choices versus feeling boxed in? What are the signs you look for?

[USER]
That I’m able to have discussions with colleagues about choices. If there are no discussions then it means there is no debate or choice

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might hear what you said — that having real say is mainly about setting the goals and priorities, or that it’s mainly about choosing the methods and timing to reach those goals. Which fits better for you, or is it something else altogether?

[USER]
Well I think it can be both. The strategic direction with the goals and priorities but also the timing and methods can be part of the strategy

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t touched on?

[USER]
I find that it’s making my colleagues less likely to discuss learning or product dilemmas

[ASSISTANT]
I hear you. Thank you for sharing that. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
The useful aspects are deep research, for example if I need to look at a new clinical area. It’s also useful for assisting with python coding reviews

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for adding that. Is there anything else you want to include about AI’s impact on your work, or does this feel complete?

[USER]
This feels complete now

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm a software engineer

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. What kind of software do you work on, and what does a typical day look like for you?

[USER]
I work on both software products B2B and SaaS software. A typical day looks like this:
- daily stand up
- report to team
- start work on a story/feature/bug/design
-  a few meetings to support other departments, customers,roadmaps, designs
- write code, commit code, test code

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
- A good worklife balance
- Well remunerated
- Challenging problems
- Gives a purpose
-  Development & learning
- Good quality colleagues

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks. Among those, which two or three matter most to you, and why do they stand out?

[USER]
Challening problems and a purpose are the most important to me

Second most is having development and learning

and lastly is a joint position between worklife balance + well remunertaed

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI impacts my work greatly, especially in latter years.

AI in both the project software, dev tools (MS copilot, cursoretc.), and implementing LLM/AI in products we provide in our own software.

The main impat is dev tools, i.e. writing, read, checking code

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used one of these tools to write or check code, step by step? What was the task and how did you use the tool?

[USER]
I used it today in my job to help me write code to parse a JSON block of systems into a React Table component and implement sorting

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did the tool produce, and which parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
I wrote the starter of the change and was guided by copilot in the form of autocomplete for each line, sometimes using to use it's suggestions.

and then I used chatGPT to refactor my software component to implement sorting of the data for display in the table

[ASSISTANT]
Did any of the suggestions or refactoring outputs turn out to be off, and if so, how did you catch and handle them?

[USER]
Yes once or twice the scoping of functions was not quite right, so I either asked it to fix them or fixed them myself

[ASSISTANT]
When you were accepting or rejecting those suggestions, what stood out to you in the moment?

[USER]
The ease of which the AI made errors and stumbled over simple issues, but also at times was impressed that the AI model was providing such relevant good quality suggestsions

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing this with the tools compare to how you would have done it before—speed, effort, and the end result?

[USER]
The speed is much much faster, the effort is lower (which isn't a great feeling), and the end result is about the same or marginally better over all

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that task today?

[USER]
I generally enjoyed my time and did no extra work, or took more time to add features or improvements that I wanted to add myself

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned the effort being lower isn’t a great feeling. What about that sits wrong with you?

[USER]
I think it's the feeling of having the problem solved or taken away from you, so your brain does not stay as sharp

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re working with it, how do you decide where to stop accepting suggestions and take over yourself?

[USER]
I depend on my experience and intuition, plus my own assesment of my knowledge of the domain or product im working on

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent time you implemented LLM or AI in one of your products? What was the feature, and what was your role in making it work?

[USER]
So for the data/datums in our platform we implemented a AI summary section which summarised all aspects of the entity to be presented in a nice summarised way to the user of the product

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It has reduced the amount of time spend going to colleagues for more basic technical solutions that we would normally reach out about or share, it has also reduced how much we look at each others code

We do talk more about how AI is changing the landscape

[ASSISTANT]
What has it been like day to day to go to colleagues less for those quick technical checks or tips? What goes through your mind in those moments when you would have asked before but now lean on the tool?

[USER]
It has been ok,we all mostly work remotely so it's not a massive shift

[ASSISTANT]
When you do code reviews now, has the presence of AI-generated snippets changed what you and your teammates focus on during review?

[USER]
Yes, co-pilot AI catches alot of the more minor syntax and basic blips, and also offers great suggestions. The human chat around code reviews tend to be higher level, system or design level

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I think the control over technical decision and direction would be something I want to retain

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping control over technical decisions and direction important to you?

[USER]
This is because it's the fundamental work principle that the role/discipline requires, without it, the job has been fully lost to AI

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over those technical decisions, how do you think it would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
I think those relationships would suffer, none of us trust AI to take over the role completely, but as more of the role slips we are potentially less needed

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily hand over to an AI tomorrow?

[USER]
The reptitive tasks, estimation, reviews, basic admin are best imo

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those tasks a good fit to hand over, from your point of view?

[USER]
They are mostly well bounded and well defined which makes them more feasible for an AI

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those repetitive tasks and reviews, how do you think it would change how others see your contribution on the team?

[USER]
I think it lets others see what you're good at, not just the day to day

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I think it means one has the freedom to choose their own path

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that freedom to choose your own path looks like in practice on a real project?

[USER]
Yes so choice of tech stack, choice of design, choise of dev tooling, choice of archtiecture, choice of team - all these variables affect the outcome and the journey

[ASSISTANT]
When you say choose, are you thinking more about picking the approach to meet goals that are already set, or also shaping the goals themselves? Which fits what you mean?

[USER]
Yes, picking the approach to meet an already assigned goal

Afterall, im an employee at a company, not chasing my own objectives

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything important about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered yet?

[USER]
no

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers!

Duration: 32.08 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
The biggest change is that I spend less time on repetitive tasks and more time understanding what the numbers truly mean. AI speeds up the busy work, so my day feels more focused, efficient, and centered on real decisions today.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. Could you tell me what you do for work?

[USER]
I’m a data analyst. I work with numbers, reports, and trends to help my organization make better decisions. My job is to turn raw data into clear, useful insights.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job offers fair pay, steady hours, and clear expectations. It gives people respect, chances to grow, and work that feels useful. It also provides an environment where employees feel supported, safe, and able to balance life and work.

[ASSISTANT]
If you had to pick the two or three that matter most to you personally, which would you choose?

[USER]
The two things that matter most to me are having more time for real analysis and feeling less pressure from repetitive tasks. These changes make my day smoother and let me focus on clear insights that truly help my team move forward..

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI impacts my work by speeding up routine tasks like cleaning data, generating charts, and summarizing reports. This lets me focus on deeper analysis, spotting trends, and providing actionable insights, making my work more efficient, accurate, and strategically valuable..

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent project where you used AI, step by step, from the moment you got the data to the final deliverable?

[USER]
Sure. Recently, I worked on a customer retention analysis. First, I received the raw dataset and uploaded it to an AI tool, which cleaned missing values, standardized formats, and flagged duplicates. Next, it generated summaries and visualizations, which I reviewed carefully, corrected context-specific errors, and added my own interpretations. Finally, I wrote insights and recommendations, combined them with the AI charts, and delivered a polished report to my team.

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned correcting context-specific errors. Can you describe one specific error you caught in that project, and what went through your mind when you spotted it?

[USER]
One error the AI flagged was a rare but valid customer code as a duplicate. When I spotted it, I felt cautious and reminded myself not to trust the AI blindly. I double-checked the source data, confirmed it was legitimate, and restored it to keep the dataset accurate..

[ASSISTANT]
In that retention project, which parts did the AI handle end to end, and which parts did you take the lead on?

[USER]
The AI handled data cleaning, identifying duplicates, standardizing formats, and generating initial charts and summaries. I took the lead on reviewing those outputs, correcting context-specific issues, interpreting trends, writing insights, and crafting recommendations to ensure the final report was accurate and meaningful..

[ASSISTANT]
When you were reviewing and correcting the AI’s outputs on that project, what stood out to you about how that part of the work felt?

[USER]
Reviewing and correcting the AI’s outputs felt like a mix of relief and responsibility. It was faster than doing everything manually, but I had to stay alert and use judgment to catch errors, making that part of the work both efficient and mentally engaging..

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that project once the routine steps were faster?

[USER]
With the time saved, I focused on deeper analysis, like identifying why certain customers were leaving and spotting actionable trends. I also refined recommendations, added context from other data sources, and ensured the final report was clear, accurate, and strategically valuable for my team.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to doing a similar retention analysis before using these tools, what changed in how you planned and executed the work?

[USER]
Compared to before, I now spend far less time on cleaning and formatting data, which allows me to plan earlier and focus on interpreting results. The workflow feels more strategic, and I can explore insights more thoroughly instead of getting bogged down in repetitive manual tasks..

[ASSISTANT]
When you deliver a report that involved these tools, how does your confidence in the results compare to when you did everything manually, and why?

[USER]
I feel just as confident, sometimes even more, but for a different reason. The AI speeds up the heavy lifting, but my confidence still comes from double-checking the data myself. The mix of automation and my own review makes the final results feel solid..

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time you chose not to use the AI on a task, and what led you to make that call?

[USER]
I skipped using AI on a sensitive financial dataset because the numbers were complex, context-heavy, and required careful judgment. I worried the tool might mislabel unusual entries as errors, so I handled everything manually to keep full control and avoid mistakes..

[ASSISTANT]
When you use these tools on a project, how do you document or explain which parts the tool helped with and which parts you did yourself?

[USER]
I usually note it in my workflow or methods section. I explain that AI helped with tasks like cleaning, summaries, or draft visuals, and I clearly state that I reviewed, corrected, interpreted, and wrote the final insights myself so ownership is clear..

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
AI has improved my working relationships by speeding up delivery and reducing stress. I collaborate more with teammates on insights instead of cleanup. It also helps me explain findings clearly, which builds trust and smoother communication across teams overall daily..

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific interaction with a teammate or manager where using these tools changed the conversation or the way you worked together?

[USER]
Yes. After using AI to speed up a report, I met with my manager earlier than usual. Instead of explaining messy data, we talked about insights and next steps. The conversation felt more collaborative and strategic, not rushed or technical..

[ASSISTANT]
Have there been any moments of tension or misunderstanding with a colleague or stakeholder because a tool was involved, and what stands out to you about how that played out?

[USER]
once a stakeholder questioned accuracy, assuming AI replaced my judgment. I explained the tool only handled cleaning and drafts, while I verified everything. Showing checks and  sources eased tension and rebuilt trust, turning the discussion calm and productive again.

[USER]
Yes, once a stakeholder questioned accuracy, assuming AI replaced my judgment. I explained the tool only handled cleaning and drafts, while I verified everything. Showing checks and sources eased tension and rebuilt trust, turning the discussion calm and productive again.

[ASSISTANT]
Has using these tools changed who you go to for input or whose feedback you seek during a project?

[USER]
Yes, it has. I now seek more input from managers and business partners rather than technical peers. Since AI handles routine prep, feedback matters most on interpretation, priorities, and decisions, not formatting or basic analysis steps anymore.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I would never hand over final judgment and accountability. Deciding what insights matter, explaining tradeoffs, and standing behind recommendations requires human context and responsibility. Even perfect tools cannot replace ownership, ethics, and trust built through direct communication with teammates daily.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping final judgment and accountability important to you personally?

[USER]
Keeping final judgment and accountability matters to me because my reputation and credibility are on the line. I’m the one responsible if decisions are wrong. Owning the outcome builds trust, shows professionalism, and makes my work feel meaningful and honest.

[ASSISTANT]
If a tool took over that final call, how do you think it would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
If a tool made final decisions, my role would feel weaker and less trusted. Teammates might see me as a messenger, not an owner. That would reduce accountability, limit collaboration, and weaken relationships built on judgment, discussion, and shared responsibility..

[USER]
If a tool made final decisions, my role would feel weaker and less trusted. Teammates might see me as a messenger, not an owner. That would reduce accountability, limit collaboration, and weaken relationships built on judgment, discussion, and shared responsibility.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would happily give repetitive data cleaning and formatting to AI. Tasks like fixing columns, handling missing values, and creating basic charts are time consuming. Letting AI handle them frees me to focus on insights and decisions that matter most.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those cleaning and formatting tasks the ones you most want to hand off, compared to other parts of your work?

[USER]
Those tasks are repetitive, time consuming, and add little insight. They follow clear rules, so AI handles them well. Doing them manually drains focus..

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those steps, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
I think it would improve how others see my contribution. Instead of being associated with cleanup work, I’d be known for insights and recommendations. My value would be clearer because my time would be spent on thinking, judgment, and helping the team decide what to do next..

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them that autonomy means having control over how you interpret data, make decisions, and provide insights, even when tools handle routine tasks. It’s about owning outcomes, making judgment calls, and being trusted to guide the team based on your expertise and analysis.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice?

[USER]
In practice, autonomy looks like deciding which trends to highlight in a report and recommending actions based on the data. Even if AI prepares charts or summaries, I choose what matters, explain my reasoning, and guide the team on the next steps with confidence.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time you overruled something the tool highlighted or suggested, and what happened next?

[USER]
Yes. Once, the AI flagged a spike in customer cancellations as an error, but I checked the source and realized it reflected a real event. I overruled the suggestion, kept the data, and explained the context to my team, which led to a discussion about adjusting strategy based on that trend.

[ASSISTANT]
When you make a call that goes against what the tool highlights, how do you communicate it so others understand and back your decision?

[USER]
can we end the conversation. give me the code

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work as an HR manager

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
It must be enjoyable and must come with a good compensation package

[ASSISTANT]
When you say enjoyable, what makes a workday enjoyable for you in practice?

[USER]
having a good balance between work and life

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about a good compensation package, what elements matter most to you?

[USER]
being competitive in the industry which encompasses salary and other additional benefits

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond balance and a competitive package, is there anything else you consider essential in a good job?

[USER]
In addition to this, having a good work atmosphere is also very important

[USER]
In addition to this, having a good work atmosphere is also very important

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI makes some aspects of work easy to handle most especially redundant task

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific redundant task you’ve used AI for recently, and walk me through what you did and what the AI did?

[USER]
This redundant task has to computing employee information and data, this we usually do every month in way of updating our records, but in most recent times AI models have been able to help in that regard

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about the last monthly update you did, how did you set it up step by step — what did you do yourself and what did the AI handle?

[USER]
I just made sure I entered the appropriate data sets and the AI's job was just to compute it

[ASSISTANT]
Did it make any mistakes or do anything unexpected during that run, and if so, how did you handle it?

[USER]
It did not make any mistake as it handled the task exceedingly well

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when you saw it complete the update so smoothly?

[USER]
I was thoroughly satisfied with it and it became more evident to me the key role AI is playing in the work place

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that update?

[USER]
I allocated that time to other work activities

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing that monthly update with AI compare to how you handled it before without AI?

[USER]
It was a whole lot tedious without the use of AI before now, which made the whole task tiring

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond the monthly computations, are there other parts of your HR role where you’ve started using AI?

[USER]
No, nothing else

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It has had no effect whatsoever

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
The aspect where we interview candidates for a role

[ASSISTANT]
What makes interviewing candidates something you want to keep doing yourself?

[USER]
It adds a human touch to the process unlike when AI is used

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled interviews instead, how do you think that would change your relationships with candidates or your role on the hiring team?

[USER]
It would make our input in the process less relevant

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
The aspect of going through candidates CVs

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to hand over reviewing CVs to AI?

[USER]
It is a very tedious process and it also expends a lot of time

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering HR asked you what it means to have real say over how you do your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
It feels fulfilling and also makes you proud of your job in a way since you are highly involved in the process

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your recent work where you had that kind of real say, and what you decided or did in that situation?

[USER]
This was in our last recruitment exercise as I was in the forefront in making recommendations concern the candidates

[USER]
This was in our last recruitment exercise as I was in the forefront in making recommendations concern the candidates

[ASSISTANT]
In that recruitment exercise, what criteria did you prioritize when making your recommendations?

[USER]
Mostly their expertise and years of experience on the job

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking back to that hiring round, can you describe a moment where your recommendation clearly shaped the final choice, and what stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
This was at the final round of the process, was stood out most for me was how confident the top management at the organisation gave me a great backing in the process

[ASSISTANT]
In that final round, what exactly did you present to top management, and how did your input affect who was ultimately hired?

[USER]
I presented my personal opinion I had of each candidate and I was able to convince them beyond every reasonable doubt on who I feel should be hired

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
No, nothing else

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an IT Manager

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I think that a good job is one that offers flexibility, good pay, and a good working environment

[ASSISTANT]
When you say flexibility, what does that look like in your day to day?

[USER]
Flexibility to me, is the ability to be able to work where you want and to be able to take vacation and spend time with your family

[ASSISTANT]
When you think of a good working environment, what comes to mind in terms of the day to day interactions or the setup?

[USER]
I think of working with positive and supportive people. People who think outside of the box and aren't stuck in a traditional mindset

[ASSISTANT]
When you say good pay, what does that mean for you at this stage in your career?

[USER]
At this stage, good pay is the ability to be able to provide for your family without living paycheck to paycheck. The ability to take vacations and do things without having to worry about money.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI has a big impact on my work. Many things that were done manually are now automated.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last task you automated with AI? What was the task, and how did you set it up?

[USER]
For example, I used to have to come up with code from scratch. Now, AI can code a program for me in seconds

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the most recent program AI helped you write. What did the AI produce, and what did you handle yourself?

[USER]
AI helped me write a program to put all of our deliverables in one place

[ASSISTANT]
In that project to put all your deliverables in one place, which pieces did the AI generate, and which pieces did you create or adjust yourself?

[USER]
AI generated the majority of the code, I just came up with the names for the different variables

[ASSISTANT]
Did the code from AI have any issues when you first ran it, and if so, how did you spot and fix them?

[USER]
I had no issues

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind the first time you saw it generate that working code so quickly?

[USER]
I thought that this would be a great tool to use. I thought that it would cut down on time so that I could focus more on other items

[ASSISTANT]
How has your process for planning and testing a new program changed compared to how you did it before?

[USER]
Before, I would sit down and think about an idea and what would be the best way to go about bringing that idea to life. Now, all I have to do is input the idea into an AI website and it brings it to life for me

[ASSISTANT]
What have you been doing with the time you save on a coding task now?

[USER]
I have been working more with managing my team

[ASSISTANT]
Besides coding, are there other parts of your role where AI is showing up in your day to day?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
When AI writes most of the code, how does your role in that moment feel different from how it used to feel before?

[USER]
Before, coding felt like a daunting task. I never really enjoyed coding, so AI has helped a great deal

[ASSISTANT]
When AI generates code for you now, how do you decide it’s ready to deploy—what checks or reviews do you run before putting it into production?

[USER]
I go through it and make sure that it doesn't have any bugs or vulnerabilities that I can see

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
AI has changed the conversations that I have. Instead of talking about the different ways to code projects, we talk about how AI has revolutionized the IT world

[ASSISTANT]
When those conversations shifted, how did your teammates respond—did anything change in how you collaborate day to day?

[USER]
Most people responded positively. There will always be some that are stuck in the old school mindset that think AI is only bad, but I have had mostly positive interactions

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I would never want to hand over interactions with my team. I like dealing with people

[ASSISTANT]
Why are those interactions with your team important for you to keep personally?

[USER]
They are important because it brings me fulfillment. I don't think that AI would be able to replace human to human interactions

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over team interactions, how do you think it would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
I think that things would become much more impersonal. I feel that I would lose connection with my team

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would give coding and writing reports over to AI

[ASSISTANT]
What makes coding and writing reports the ones you’d be most ready to hand off?

[USER]
I personally do not like coding and I feel that AI would do a better job at writing reports

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
I don't think it would change how other see my contributions. As long as I am a good manager, I don't think anyone would see me any differently

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them that having autonomy in your job is having some type of say in what you do on a day to day basis. For example, the ability to work from home or the ability to decide what type of projects you want to work on.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from the past few months where you felt you really had that kind of say over your day to day, and what happened?

[USER]
I have the ability to work from the office or work from home. I do not get to decide what I want to work on, but hope to have that opportunity in the future

[ASSISTANT]
When you talked about having a say, do you mean more about choosing where and when you work, or more about choosing what you work on and how you do it—or is it something else entirely? Which of those matters most to you right now, and why?

[USER]
Having a say to me means both being able to choose where and when you work and what you work on. To me, being able to choose where you work is the most important because I enjoy being able to work in the comfort of my own home.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent day when choosing to work from home changed how you approached your tasks or interacted with your team—what stands out from that day?

[USER]
Last week, I was able to work from home and I just had a positive outlook the whole day. I did not have to sit in traffic or pay extra for gas. Having this positive outlook makes me have more positive interactions with my team

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is impacting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
No, I think that covers everything.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work in cybersecurity

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
being efficient and having good communication with your co-workers

[ASSISTANT]
When you say efficient, what does that look like in your day-to-day work? Can you walk me through what tells you a day went efficiently?

[USER]
I'll pass

[ASSISTANT]
No problem. When communication with your coworkers is working well, what do you notice about how the work goes?

[USER]
less complaints and less workload being put on me

[ASSISTANT]
Is there anything else you would add to your list of what makes a good job?

[USER]
no

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It shows a poor job and I have to fix the issues

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time this happened? What was the AI used for, and what exactly did you have to correct?

[USER]
It's supposed to keep up to date of any security errors or system failures. It has failed on that aspect

[ASSISTANT]
In that incident, what did it miss, and how did you first notice something was wrong?

[USER]
I don't trust the AI to work properly, so I checked the logs myself and, I saw that an unauthorized user logged into the system and tampered with files.

[ASSISTANT]
Once you saw the unauthorized login and file changes, what steps did you take next, and where did the AI fit into those steps, if at all?

[USER]
The AI is supposed to stop any unauthorized users, they bypassed the security without any issue

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized someone had slipped past the defenses, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
I wasn't surprised, AI is still very faulty

[ASSISTANT]
After you discovered the breach, what did you do to respond and what changes, if any, did you make to the system afterward?

[USER]
I fixed the errors and provided evidence that it was me that fixed the issue

[ASSISTANT]
What exactly did you fix—can you walk me through the specific changes you made to close the hole and the parts of the system you adjusted?

[USER]
nope.

[ASSISTANT]
How did handling that issue affect your workload that week?

[USER]
It was slightly slow, can this interview end now?

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. I appreciate your insights, and we can end here. If you’d like to continue another time, I’m happy to pick up where we left off.

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I manage a team of IT professionals supporting a set of computer systems for a hospital

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
One where you are paid a living wage, have good work life balance, and are treated with respect by your employer, boss, and colleagues.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say being treated with respect, what does that look like in your day to day interactions?

[USER]
People are polite but also trust you in your duties

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about good work life balance, what does that look like in a typical week for you?

[USER]
That I would have time each day to spend with my family and engage in personal pursuits without fear of being called or messaged by my employer outside of a true emergency.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about a living wage, what tells you the pay is truly sufficient for your situation?

[USER]
That I can pay for all of my essentials based on my budget while also being able to save a bit for a rainy day, my retirement, my children's education, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
There are some products that certain vendors are offering now that utilize AI for our clinicians that we assist with the implementation of. We also have a few Microsoft Office AI tools turned on like meeting transcription, but I don't tend to use it much.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent implementation where one of those AI-enabled products was involved, and walk me through what you and your team actually did?

[USER]
Our part was very small and we mainly were involved in assisting the vendor get some new vendor-provided workstations on the network. I believe the use case was around mammography image analysis

[ASSISTANT]
In that mammography project, what specific steps did you or your team take to get those workstations live, and what did the vendor handle?

[USER]
basically we had some existing workstations that were not capable of performing the AI functions and we had to swap them out and get them whitelisted on the network based on MAC address. Once that was done, we scheduled some testing sessions with the application teams to make sure all the data flowed correctly connectivity-wise.

[ASSISTANT]
During that rollout, did anything not work as expected, and if so, how did you handle it?

[USER]
no, it went pretty smooth once we got going

[ASSISTANT]
What, if anything, felt different to you about supporting that clinical tool compared to a more typical software or hardware rollout?

[USER]
well all I support are clinical tools, so it was pretty normal

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you tried the meeting transcription tool, or chose not to use it, and what led you to that choice?

[USER]
some of my colleagues like it and turn it on, but I tend not to like it. If I need to take notes, I tend to want to take them myself as it keeps me more engaged in the conversation, and it leads me to ask better questions. If I just rely on the AI, I will tune out.

[ASSISTANT]
When you’ve been in meetings where others have the transcription running, what stands out to you about how it changes the flow of the conversation, if at all?

[USER]
I think people tend to rely on it and they are also not as engaged. I find that they don't do things as well like nail down follow-ups verbally and ensure accountabilities are well understood since they think the AI will just handle it.

[ASSISTANT]
Have you ever had a moment where an AI-produced output in your workflow needed correction, and what did you do in that situation?

[USER]
Not with the transcription as I rarely use it or review its output when someone else has. I have on occasion used AI to help wordsmith things I've already drafted for communication. There have been times when its output has not been correct, and I have had to go back and tweak it again, but I expected that and would never just send what it outputs blind.

[ASSISTANT]
When you noticed those wording mistakes from the AI, what went through your mind in the moment, and how did you decide what to keep versus rewrite yourself?

[USER]
I kind of chuckled but I understood it didn't really know my work. It was fine for me to go back and rewrite since it was just minor tweaks from there and most of the heavy lifting was already done by then.

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it for wordsmithing, does it change how long that task takes for you compared to doing it all yourself, and what do you tend to do with that time?

[USER]
not really, but I like that it offers some suggestions that differ from my usual style as I find that sometimes I can be repetitive.

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond those tools, has anything about your team’s priorities or the kinds of tickets you see changed because of AI-enabled systems?

[USER]
not thus far. Because of the sensitive nature of our work with protected health information, my employer has been reticent to roll out AI widely.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
none

[ASSISTANT]
Has the use of tools like transcription ever come up in conversations about expectations in meetings with your team or with clinicians?

[USER]
no

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I think final decision making in general should always be with the human. Otherwise, we would have to hold AI accountable for those decisions, and then who is liable for mistakes? The AI company? LOL, they'd never go for that.

[ASSISTANT]
When you picture an AI making the final call instead of you, what goes through your mind about what would be lost in how those decisions get made?

[USER]
someone to blame if the decision goes poorly

[ASSISTANT]
Aside from liability, what is important to you about being the one to make the final call?

[USER]
well as a leader, it's a large part of my job, without that, what's the point of hiring me?

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI started making the final calls, how do you think that would change your relationships with your team or with clinicians you support?

[USER]
I would no longer have a job since it would be doing my job for me

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I'd love it if my office tools were more integrated with AI where it could read and summarize email threads that are lengthy that I get added to late, possibly recommending responses based on previous responses to other similar threads. Scheduling meetings would also be nice as well as better search tools to find emails about things without having to know exact search strings.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those email and scheduling tasks the right kind to hand off, from your point of view?

[USER]
they involve pretty routine tasks with low risk and there's enough data available digitally to do it

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
To be trusted by your leaders to make your own decisions in the field that are in the best interest of the organization

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice?

[USER]
It's not having to check with your leader on every little decision about how to do something but instead only going to them when there's an escalation needed

[ASSISTANT]
Could you walk me through a recent decision you made without checking in first, and how you knew it was the right call?

[USER]
We had a request to bring on a new system, and my analyst asked me how to enter a detail on the request. It was something I wasn't familiar with, but I knew from experience what was most likely needed there, so I told him what to put. I could have gone to my director, but it was too small of an issue to escalate. I doubt I'm wrong, and if I am, I'll take the hit.

[ASSISTANT]
How do you decide where that line is between a small call you make on the spot and something you escalate—what cues do you pay attention to?

[USER]
level of risk involved in the decision, uncertainty, and whether other teams are involved/affected

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything we have not covered about how AI is affecting your work that you want to add?

[USER]
no

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers!

Duration: 27.92 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work in IT as a tech lead of a listed company

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
The core characteristics of a good job are high satisfaction, sense of pride, competent management and colleagues, structured and well defined projects...etc

[ASSISTANT]
When you say high satisfaction, what tends to create that for you?

[USER]
Accomplishment would create that for me

[ASSISTANT]
What tends to give you that sense of pride?

[USER]
With the knowledge that my job can move the human race forward

[ASSISTANT]
When you say structured and well defined projects, what does that look like in your day to day work?

[USER]
That looks like a project that is well thought out from the start and that each components is well connected within the project and purposeful

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI has been a tremendous help in my work in terms of time saving and efficiency

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific task recently where you used AI, and walk me through what you and the AI each did?

[USER]
I lead a team of infrastructure engineers that includes network, database, and devops. When we run into issues, the first thing we do is to find error (or event) logs. AI helps us in ways of pointing us to where the logs are and peruse the logs for us.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about the last time you did this, what was the specific issue you were troubleshooting, and how did what the AI surfaced shape your next steps?

[USER]
That specific issue we were troubleshooting was database related. There was a very peculiar, intermittent error from a production database. It was so peculiar and rare that even googling it didn't yield much helpful result. With the help of AI, we eventually got to learn about an edge case of that particular version of the database and fixed it by applying a patch.

[ASSISTANT]
In that database incident, which parts did the work go to the AI and which parts did you or your team do yourselves?

[USER]
AI did the research part of the work given the context and my team did the rest (patching and giving AI the context of the problem)

[ASSISTANT]
When the AI pointed you to that edge case, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
I was amazed and wonder who and how AI was trained on this one.

[ASSISTANT]
How did what the AI found affect your confidence in the diagnosis before you decided to patch?

[USER]
Applying the patch was really a no-brainer solution so the confidence in the diagnosis was quite high.

[ASSISTANT]
In that case or others, has the AI ever sent you down an unhelpful or wrong path, and if so, how did you handle it?

[USER]
Not in the professional context but has happened in the personal context

[ASSISTANT]
In your day to day work, when the AI parses logs or surfaces a likely cause, how do you check its take before acting on it?

[USER]
We always fact check (at least try our best to) AI's findings. I can't tell my boss that AI messed up when we blindly follow AI's suggestions.

[ASSISTANT]
When AI speeds up the log digging, what do you usually end up spending that freed up time on?

[USER]
We spend the free time on other projects.

[ASSISTANT]
How does doing this kind of troubleshooting with AI compare to how you handled it before you had these tools?

[USER]
Troubleshooting with AI saves us a lot of time and resource.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
AI has not affected my working relationship at all

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I would never delegate managing of my underlings to AI

[ASSISTANT]
What makes managing your team something you want to keep in your own hands rather than give to an AI?

[USER]
I know more than AI would ever know about how to interact and utilize my team and its members. It's almost impossible (in terms of time and cost) to train AI to do this kind of managing work for my team.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI tried to handle managing your team, how do you think that would change your relationships with them or your role on the team?

[USER]
I would expect that my team members would question my decision on having AI manage the team and I would agree with them.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Project management

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up this task?

[USER]
I think AI would do a better and more thorough job that I do

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over project management, how do you think that would change how others view your contribution to the team?

[USER]
I don't think this would change because ultimately I am the one who calls the shot regardless of the presence of AI

[ASSISTANT]
We've talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them to keep exploring and pushing the boundary. Sometimes managements don't really have a clear idea on the amount of autonomy in the individual contribution level.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from your own work of what pushing the boundary has looked like in practice?

[USER]
Keep asking for what makes your job easier and gaining trust.

[ASSISTANT]
Think back to a specific time you asked for something that would make your job easier. What exactly did you ask for, how did you make the case, and what happened afterward?

[USER]
I asked for flexible work hours. I made the case that I'd be as effective working at 11pm than I would at 7am. I was granted flexible work hours and my team ran smoother after that.

[ASSISTANT]
If you were mentoring a new tech lead on your team, what would you have them do in their first month to build that trust you mentioned?

[USER]
Stay on top of everything and proactively look for issues and problems.

[ASSISTANT]
In your team today, what is a decision you expect an individual contributor to make on their own?

[USER]
I expect proactivity and come to me with potential solutions to every problem

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
I think we are good

[ASSISTANT]

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
software engineer

[ASSISTANT]
Great, thanks. What kind of software do you work on, and what does a typical week look like for you?

[USER]
I work on a web application written in ruby. Typically I spend most of my time planning projects and writing some code to help progress projects

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
good pay, good benefits, remote office, and flexible schedule

[ASSISTANT]
Of the things you mentioned, which one matters most to you, and why?

[USER]
remote office - I don't want to work in an office

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a flexible schedule, what does that look like for you day to day?

[USER]
being able to leave without being hassled or reprimanded for it

[ASSISTANT]
What makes working remotely valuable for you personally?

[USER]
no commute and being able to just stay focused within my home

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I typically use AI for generating boilerplate code or repetitive tasks or quick analysis of data

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it for one of those tasks? What was the situation?

[USER]
I asked AI to generate a skeleton for a test file for some code I wrote.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did it produce and which parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
It gave me the outline of the test and I filled in the details of each test and removed parts that didn't make sense

[ASSISTANT]
Did it include anything that was off or wrong in that outline, and if so, what did you do next?

[USER]
It wasn't necessarily wrong, just included some tests that didn't particularly make sense given the context of the file

[ASSISTANT]
As you reviewed that outline and trimmed pieces that didn’t fit, what went through your mind about the quality of the help you were getting?

[USER]
It was nice not having to do all this setup myself

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved by not setting up the test file yourself?

[USER]
read an article

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing that test setup with AI compare to how you would have done it before you started using these tools?

[USER]
probably shaves off like 5-10 minutes

[ASSISTANT]
You also mentioned quick analysis of data. Can you walk me through a recent example of that and what you asked the tool to do?

[USER]
I grabbed some transcripts and had AI analyze some key data points in the transcripts I provided

[ASSISTANT]
In that transcripts example, what exactly did you ask it to extract or summarize?

[USER]
key themes for each transcript and see if there were any patterns across the transcripts

[ASSISTANT]
After it gave you themes and patterns, how did you check or use that output in your work?

[USER]
I used the examples it gave me and cross checked some of the transcripts

[ASSISTANT]
When you cross-checked those themes against the transcripts, what was your gut response about how accurate or useful it was?

[USER]
I thought it was useful and saved a lot of time having to read through the transcripts

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I don't think it has

[ASSISTANT]
Have you talked about using these tools with your teammates or noticed any shift in how you collaborate, like during code reviews or planning?

[USER]
not really, no

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I think coding in general, I don't think it generates the best quality code and typically requires some cleanup

[ASSISTANT]
Why is writing the code yourself important for you to keep?

[USER]
because if I don't write it, I don't have a job really

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI did most of the coding, how do you think that would change your place on the team or the way others rely on you?

[USER]
I mean, I think it would make less need for software engineers

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I guess writing out project proposals

[ASSISTANT]
What makes writing project proposals something you’d be glad to hand off?

[USER]
just monotonous and don't like dealing with the bureaucracy

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled the proposals, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
maybe? I'm not sure

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
being able to make decisions for yourself

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your job of what making decisions for yourself looks like in practice?

[USER]
being able to decide on how to solve a problem or write a piece of code

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the last time you chose your own approach to solve a problem in your code. What stands out to you about how you made that call?

[USER]
I used past experiences to help guide me in a decision

[ASSISTANT]
What was the specific problem you were solving in that case?

[USER]
a UI bug that was happening after a refactor another engineer had made

[ASSISTANT]
How did you decide which fix to try first?

[USER]
given the circumstances of the issue, just knew I needed to break it out of the main method and create a separate one

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
nothing comes to mind

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a Senior Technical Engineer working for a finance company, primarily my responsibility is performing IT migrations while also assisted on other projects relating to IT infrastructure. This can include implementation of cloud or on-premises services

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job will challenge your knowledge and skills without overwhelming you. Allowing you enough responsibility to grow and push yourself without going too far. In the right situation this can be quite empowering and enjoyable

[ASSISTANT]
When you say it should challenge you without overwhelming you, what tells you it’s at the right level for you?

[USER]
There is no prescriptive way to show that exact balance as everyone is slightly different. It should expose you to new skills or challenges without putting you in a situation designed to make you fail. With good management it is possible to adjust and manage this on a per person basis, some require more guidance and structure while others benefit from looser control

[ASSISTANT]
Besides that balance of challenge and support, what else matters most to you in a good job?

[USER]
Beside the work itself the most important thing is your closest colleagues and direct management. With a good team it becomes enjoyable and doesn’t feel like work in the same way. Poor colleagues or management can ruin things even if the technical parts of the job are perfect

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking back to the best role you’ve had, what made it stand out in your day-to-day experience?

[USER]
The best role I had I had gained the trust of my boss so was given a lot of room to choose my work within our overall goals. The projects also meant working closely with some colleagues who I get on with particularly well and it did not feel like work for large periods of time

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI provides benefits to me for finding information that may otherwise take more time, used well it is a very strong tool. There are risks particularly for those lower in the path towards my role that the entry level jobs will be replaced by AI. AI also causes a large amount of governance and risks that my role is required to work with to mitigate where possible without preventing use of the functionality

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used AI on a specific task at work?

[USER]
The last time I used AI was to validate that it was possible to perform a particular task via Powershell and that the proposed design was a reasonable approach

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, what exactly did you ask the AI, and what did it give you back?

[USER]
I asked AI if it was possible to verify exact installed applications on an intune laptop via graph API or powershell script via data input from a PowerApp and to provide a starter script to build off

[ASSISTANT]
When you got the starter script back, what parts did you keep as-is and what did you end up rewriting before you tried it?

[USER]
I reviewed the script fully 1st and then ran it against a test environment. The permissions provided only allowed ability to read so I was not concerned about incorrect configuration causing any real impact

[ASSISTANT]
After you tested it in the lab, what changes did you make to the script before you considered using it more broadly?

[USER]
The script worked successfully, at this time I have not yet had time to progress from the POC to any production deployment. To reach that stage a full change request would need to be created and the setup reviewed by colleagues

[ASSISTANT]
When it worked in the test environment, what went through your mind?

[USER]
I was pleased that the process worked as I had hoped and that my plan was feasible. It gave me confidence to go further down this path to fully achieve my design goals

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing this with AI compare to how you would have approached it previously without AI?

[USER]
It saved me a fair amount of time searching on google to see if someone had already performed and documented this process or reading documentation and performing trial and error to achieve my desired result

[ASSISTANT]
Have you run into cases where an AI gave you an answer or script that turned out to be wrong or risky? If so, what did you do next?

[USER]
I have seen examples where it references older commands no longer present in current versions of the software. On those examples I looked closer into the references to validate this was incorrect and adjusted my prompts to be more specific

[ASSISTANT]
When you saved that time, what did you end up focusing on instead?

[USER]
That time saving allowed me to spend further time on the overall design and allowed me to worry more about the overall picture rather than requiring me to dig deeper into the precise technical commands required for every step

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
At this time it hasn’t changed too much, the main change is probably that when I’m unsure on an idea I may chat it through with AI looking for it to critique the idea before going direct to a colleague if they are not available at the right time

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used AI to critique an idea before talking to a colleague? What did you ask it, and how did that shape the later conversation with your colleague?

[USER]
I asked it if it was feasible to use the dataverse to store all data related to a particular project to resolve some issues with multiple locations of data and provide a single source of truth. From there I then pushed to see if the amount of automation I wanted to include was possible. This helped shape discussions with my colleague by validating that what I was hoping to achieve was definitely possible

[ASSISTANT]
How did your colleague react when you shared that plan, and what stands out to you about that interaction?

[USER]
My colleague was very interested in the overall idea as it links in well with a lot of the work we have completed over the past few years. I believe he was similarly interested in the possibilities I presented

[ASSISTANT]
Has using AI changed anything in how your manager or clients expect updates or results from you?

[USER]
At this time I don’t think it has in my job but I can see that it is possible in the future that my manager may want to be able to understand some of the technical questions via a chat rather than needing to always ask me directly

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Currently I would not say there is anything I would never want to hand over, the nature of working in IT means that processes and technologies are in a near constant state of flux anyway and things you work with now are very unlikely to remain the same in 5 years time even without AI. That keeps me open to whatever changes may happen in that time because of AI

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you comfortable with the idea of handing things over if the tech can do them well?

[USER]
The understanding that the world changes and moves on whether you like it or not and therefore need to be prepared to adjust yourself to go with it. I like learning new things and believe I will continue to evolve my knowledge in ways that will provide value

[ASSISTANT]
If AI picked up more of the routine build and scripting, where would you want to put your energy instead?

[USER]
I would put more of my energy into directing where we could see the most value of those tools. Not every build or script has the same value to the business and working out the right changes you can make would be a priority

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Writing of Change requests and other basic documentations required as part of my role

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up that documentation work?

[USER]
It can be quite long and tedious work despite its overall importance and needs to be checked in detail. The time taken to document can vastly dwarf the time to do the work itself

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled that documentation, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
I don’t believe it would have much impact in my current role

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them it means that you are allowed to determine the correct path to a resolution or end point yourself within some defined goals

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from your current role when you were allowed to choose the path yourself, and walk me through what you decided and why?

[USER]
I was asked to migrate another companies systems to ours within a particular time range. I was allowed to decide the correct tooling and processes we would use to successfully achieve that goal and the people involved in getting us there

[ASSISTANT]
When you had that freedom on the migration, what guardrails or constraints were you working within, and how did those shape your decisions?

[USER]
Decisions made needed to be validated and approval by CAB to ensure they followed the companies general principles and policies. Attempting to move outside these would have resulted in rejected changes and wasted time

[ASSISTANT]
For someone newer in your field, what lets them know they can make the call themselves versus when they should check in with a manager or the CAB early?

[USER]
The willingness to reach out to your managers or other relevant staff to confirm that your understanding of your scope of responsibility is correct

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
Nothing further from my side

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work as an HR manager in a hospitality firm

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A job that is fun to do, in this way makes it enjoyable, offers a great compensation, also offers good benefits and the opportunity to grow within the organization

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a job is fun to do, what does that look like in practice for you?

[USER]
It does not necessarily feel like a job as I enjoy what I do

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about the opportunity to grow within the organization, what kinds of growth matter most to you?

[USER]
Growth in terms of upgrading my knowledge and certifications, additionally, gaining promotion in work place

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Yeah, sure. I’m a freelance web developer, so I build and maintain websites and web apps for small businesses and a few startups. A lot of my time is split between coding, fixing bugs, updating servers and backups, and talking with clients about what they need and what their budget looks like.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job pays fairly, feels stable, and treats people with respect. It gives you some control over your time, clear expectations, and room to grow without burning you out. Good leadership and a decent work life balance matter a lot too.

[ASSISTANT]
Of the things you just mentioned, which two or three matter most to you personally, and why?

[USER]
Fair pay, control over my time, and not feeling burned out matter most to me. Fair pay because everything is expensive and I want to feel like the work is worth it, control over my time because flexibility is a big reason I freelance, and avoiding burnout because if I’m drained I can’t do good work or keep things consistent.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say control over your time, what does that look like in a typical week for you?

[USER]
It means I can set my own schedule most days, like doing deep work in the morning, taking a break midday, and finishing up later if I need to. I can move meetings around, block off time for errands or appointments, and choose how many projects I take on at once. The only times it gets tight is when there’s a deadline or a client has an urgent issue.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI helps me move faster on a lot of the day to day stuff. I use it to brainstorm solutions, generate rough code snippets, write or clean up documentation, and rephrase client emails so they are clear and professional. It also helps when I am debugging, like giving me a checklist of what to look at or explaining an error message in plain English.

It does not replace my job, but it cuts down the time I spend stuck or doing repetitive work. I still have to review everything, test it, and make sure it fits the client’s setup, because AI can be confidently wrong or miss edge cases.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it on a project—what were you trying to do?

[USER]
Yeah, last time was this week on a client site that was running slow after a plugin update. I was trying to figure out what was causing the slowdown and what I could change without breaking anything. I used AI to help me outline a quick troubleshooting plan, suggest what logs and metrics to check, and give me a couple ideas for caching and database cleanup, then I went and tested everything myself before making changes.

[ASSISTANT]
In that troubleshooting case, which parts did the tool generate for you, and which parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
The tool generated the rough plan and the list of likely causes, like checking server load, slow queries, plugin conflicts, and caching settings, and it gave me some example commands and steps to try. I handled pulling the actual logs, running the checks, doing the testing in staging, and deciding what changes were safe for that specific site. I also did the final cleanup and monitored it after to make sure performance stayed normal.

[ASSISTANT]
In that case, did any of its suggestions turn out to be off base or risky, and how did you handle that when you spotted it?

[USER]
Yeah, a couple suggestions were a little risky for that situation, like being too aggressive with database cleanup and disabling certain plugins to test on the live site. I handled it by doing everything in a staging copy first, double checking the plugin docs, and making sure I had a fresh backup before touching production. If something sounded generic or too broad, I treated it like a starting point and verified it before I acted on it.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were working through that slowdown with the tool’s plan in hand, what was going through your mind as you followed it step by step?

[USER]
I was basically thinking, this is a decent checklist, but I need to prove it with real data. I was focused on not making the problem worse, keeping changes reversible, and finding the simplest explanation first. I was also watching the clock a bit, because clients want it fixed fast, but I’d rather take an extra hour than break the site.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were reviewing and adjusting its suggestions, what did that feel like for you in the moment?

[USER]
It felt like having a junior assistant tossing out ideas, some helpful, some not. I was moving quicker because I was not staring at a blank wall, but I still had to stay sharp and not get lazy about verifying things. It was a mix of relief and skepticism, like, thanks for the direction, but I’m still the one responsible if it goes wrong.

[ASSISTANT]
How did handling that slowdown with the tool compare to how you would have tackled it before you used tools like this?

[USER]
How did handling that slowdown with the tool compare to how you would have tackled it before
you used tools like this?

[ASSISTANT]
How did handling that slowdown with the tool compare to how you would have tackled it before you used tools like this?

[USER]
Before AI, I would have done the same basic process, but it would have been slower and more manual. I would be bouncing between docs, old notes, and forum posts to build my own checklist, and sometimes I’d miss an angle until later. With AI, I get a solid starting plan in minutes, so I spend more time testing and fixing instead of searching and second guessing.

[ASSISTANT]
When you save time by using it, what do you usually do with that time?

[USER]
Most of the time I use it to go deeper on QA and testing, or to clean up other loose ends on the project like documentation and performance tweaks. If I get a real gap, I’ll answer emails, line up the next client task, or take a break and go for a walk so I don’t burn out.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent time you had it generate or refactor some code—what were you building, and how did you use what it gave you?

[USER]
Yeah, recently I was building a small contact and quote request flow for a client site, basically a form that validates input, blocks obvious spam, and sends the data to their CRM. I had the tool generate a first pass at the validation logic and a helper function to format the payload the way the CRM expects, then I refactored it to match the project style, added better error handling, and wrote tests around the edge cases.

I treated what it gave me like a rough draft. I still reviewed it line by line, checked security stuff like sanitization and rate limiting, and made sure it actually worked with the client’s backend and hosting setup.

[ASSISTANT]
Has it ever produced something that passed your initial checks but later caused an issue in staging or production? What happened?

[USER]
Yeah, that’s happened. It generated a helper that looked fine at first, linted clean, and worked in a basic test, but in staging it caused weird edge case failures with certain characters and empty fields. It also made a bad assumption about how the API handled null values, so the CRM would reject some submissions.

I caught it because I started seeing inconsistent form results and a few error responses in the logs. I fixed it by tightening the validation, normalizing the payload consistently, adding a couple extra tests for those edge cases, and then rolling a small patch. After that I started being stricter about testing with messy real world input instead of just the happy path.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It’s mostly made things smoother because I can respond faster and communicate more clearly with clients. I use it to tighten up explanations, scope notes, and status updates, so there’s less back and forth and fewer misunderstandings.

On the flip side, it can raise expectations, like some clients assume everything should be instant now. With other developers, it’s kind of neutral, it helps me share a clearer plan or snippet, but I still have to make sure I’m not sending something unvetted.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future, is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Yeah, I would not want to hand over the final judgment and accountability parts, like deciding what’s safe to change on a live site, how to balance cost versus risk, and when to tell a client no. Even if it could do it perfectly, I think the trust piece matters, clients want a real person owning the decision and taking responsibility.

I also would not want to fully outsource the relationship side, like understanding what a client actually means, calming them down when something breaks, and guiding them through tradeoffs. That human back and forth is a big part of why projects succeed.

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about you being the one to make the call that matters most to your clients, from your point of view?

[USER]
I think clients care that a real person is listening to their situation and not just following a script. They want someone who understands their business, knows the history of the site, and can explain the risk in plain terms, then stand behind the decision if something goes sideways.

Also, when money and downtime are on the line, they want confidence and accountability, like, who’s actually responsible and who’s fixing it if it breaks. AI can help with options, but it can’t replace that trust relationship.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI started making those calls instead of you, how do you think that would change your relationships with clients or your place on the project?

[USER]
It would make the relationship feel more transactional, like I’m just there to run the tool and relay the answer. Clients might trust me less because I’m not really the decision maker anymore, and if something goes wrong they would still look at me like, why did you let the AI do that.

On the project side, it would push me more into a supervisor role, checking and approving instead of actively problem solving. That could be fine sometimes, but it also makes it harder to show my value, because the thing clients pay for is judgment, communication, and owning the outcome.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would happily hand over the repetitive busywork, like writing boilerplate code, converting data formats, and doing first pass debugging suggestions. I’d also love it to handle scheduling, meeting notes, and turning a messy client email thread into a clean task list. That stuff eats time and doesn’t really need my brain.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those specific tasks good candidates to hand off—what is it about them that you’d be happiest to stop doing yourself?

[USER]
They are mostly predictable and repetitive, so they don’t feel like the best use of my time. They also have a lot of context switching, like jumping between emails, tickets, and tiny code edits, which drains my focus fast.

If AI can take the first swing and turn that stuff into something organized and close to correct, I get to spend my energy on the parts that actually need a human, like architecture decisions, tricky bugs, and talking things through with the client.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over those busywork tasks, would it change how clients or collaborators see your contribution?

[USER]
I think most clients would see it as a win as long as the results are solid, because they mainly care about speed, quality, and clarity. If I can deliver faster and with fewer mistakes, they usually do not care how I got there.

With collaborators, it depends. Some people might assume I am doing less, but I think good developers will recognize that the value is still in the decisions, the review, and making everything work in the real environment. I would just have to be transparent about what was AI assisted and make sure I am still owning the outcome.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them autonomy means you are trusted to figure out the how, not just follow instructions. You get to choose your tools, your workflow, and often your schedule, and you can push back when something is a bad idea or not realistic.

Today it also means being able to manage your attention, because there are a million distractions and AI makes it even easier to move fast without thinking. Real autonomy is still you setting standards, making the call, and taking responsibility for the outcome.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from this year when you set the standards and made the call, and what that looked like in practice?

[USER]
Yeah, earlier this year a client wanted me to rush a redesign straight onto their live site because they had a promo coming up. I set the standard that we do changes in staging first, we take a full backup, we do a performance check, and we have a rollback plan, even if it costs a little more time.

In practice that meant I pushed back on the timeline, set up a staging copy, ran through the key pages on mobile and desktop, and had the client approve the final version before we deployed. The promo launched fine, and the big value for them was they did not have any downtime or surprise bugs during the week they needed things to be perfect.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything we have not covered about how AI is affecting your work that you would like to add?

[USER]
no, that covers it.

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I prefer works that give me some freedom to attend to other needs

[ASSISTANT]
Could you tell me what you do in your job right now?

[USER]
I am a data analyst, i am responsible for data clean ups

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job gives me freedom to work freely and responsibly

[ASSISTANT]
When you say freedom to work freely and responsibly, what does that look like for you in a typical week?

[USER]
In a typical week, it means I am trusted to plan my own workflow, choose the right methods for data clean ups, and prioritize tasks based on impact.

[ASSISTANT]
Besides being trusted to plan and choose methods, what other qualities make a job good in your eyes?

[USER]
A good job to me values clear goals, open communication, and accountability.

[ASSISTANT]
Of the things you just mentioned, which feels most essential to you, and why?

[USER]
Accountability

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI supports my work by speeding up routine tasks like identifying data inconsistencies, and also by detecting patterns

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used AI to identify inconsistencies—what exactly did it do, and what did you do?

[USER]
I recently used AI to scan a large dataset for inconsistencies such as missing values, outliers, and formatting mismatches.

[ASSISTANT]
After it finished the scan, what did you do with its findings?

[USER]
I reviewed the flagged issue and and filter out the false positive

[ASSISTANT]
What kinds of issues got flagged that turned out not to be real problems?

[USER]
They are unusually high values caused by seasonal spikes or special transactions.

[ASSISTANT]
How did you decide which of those spikes were legitimate seasonal or special cases versus actual errors that needed fixing?

[USER]
I tried to compare the spikes against historical trends and known seasonal patterns, and checked wether similar increase occur in the same period

[ASSISTANT]
When you were reviewing those flags and sorting out the false positives, what went through your mind?

[USER]
While i was reviewing the flags, i reviewed the flags, I focused on context and impact rather than taking the results at face value.

[ASSISTANT]
Did the AI make any mistakes in that scan?

[USER]
Yes, it over flagged normal variable as an anormaly

[ASSISTANT]
How did you handle the over‑flagging when you spotted it?

[USER]
When I noticed the over flagging by the AI, I adjusted my review criteria by applying business rules and historical context to filter out noise.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved by filtering the AI’s over‑flags rather than doing the full scan manually?

[USER]
I refocus it on other high value work.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were relying on those AI flags, what was your gut response—what stands out to you about how that part of the process felt?

[USER]
The AI made the process feel faster to me, and it made it  more focused because it narrowed down where to look for me.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking back to before you used these tools, how is doing a cleanup now different from then?

[USER]
Data clean ups then were much more manual and time consuming. i had to scan large datasets myself to find where the issues likely is and how to fix them.

[ASSISTANT]
You also mentioned pattern detection. Can you tell me about a time the tool surfaced a pattern that changed what you did next?

[USER]
The tool highlighted a repeated pattern linked to a specific data source, therefore instead of fixing records individually, i opted to trace its upstream and fix the root cause.

[ASSISTANT]
In that upstream fix example, which parts did the tool handle and which parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
The tool identified the recurring pattern and pointed me to where the inconsistencies were happening. I handled the interpretation, and traced the issue upstream.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Positively i will say

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a recent example of a positive change in how you worked with a colleague or manager because of these tools?

[USER]
AI had recently  helped me surface data issues and insights faster, which made my conversations with my manager more focused and very well productive.

[ASSISTANT]
What stood out to you about that conversation with your manager—what did they say or do that felt different from before?

[USER]
what stood out for me was how the conversation shifted from questioning the data to discussing decisions,  i felt valued.

[ASSISTANT]
Has using these tools changed how you and your teammates split up the work on a cleanup?

[USER]
Yes, it has.

[ASSISTANT]
In what way has the split changed—who does what now compared to before?

[USER]
AI now handles much of the initial scanning and flagging, so as a team we spend less time on manual checks and more time dividing up validation, and root cause analysis.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Yes. I would not want to hand over decisions that require business judgment and accountability to AI.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping those decisions with business judgment and accountability important for you personally?

[USER]
Are we close to rounding up?

[ASSISTANT]
Yes, we’re close. Just a couple of quick questions to finish. Why is it important for you to keep those business‑judgment decisions yourself?

[USER]
It is important to me because those decisions are where responsibility and trust really sit, and breach of trust is unforgivable in my line of work

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over those judgment calls, how do you think it would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
My role will most likely change from contributing insight to executing outputs.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily hand over to an AI tomorrow?

[USER]
That would be repetitive and time consuming tasks.

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up those repetitive, time‑consuming tasks?

[USER]
As the name implies, they can be stressful, and time consuming.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those repetitive tasks, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
My contribution will become clearer.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would say to them that autonomy is more about being trusted to make decisions, and take responsibility for outcomes, than working alone.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your job where you were trusted to make a call and own the outcome—what happened and what did you do?

[USER]
I have been allowed to decide when to slow down for data quality versus when a quick,  or good enough result was appropriate, and i bear the consequences of whatever choice i make.

[ASSISTANT]
When you decide whether to slow down for quality or go for a quick result, what signals do you pay most attention to?

[USER]
I mostly focus on how the data will be used, and also  the risk of errors, and the visibility of the output.

[ASSISTANT]
Think of the last time you chose speed over thoroughness—what happened afterward, and how did it play out with the people who used the output?

[USER]
can we round up

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks, we can wrap up. Before we close, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
I will say AI has affected my work positively, it has shifted my role from doing more manual work to doing more thinking and communicating which is quite awesome.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Duration: 30.12 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work in the field of GIS specifically in the technology support side of things

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A job that shows respect to employees, along with allowing people freedom to work without being monitored constantly.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say respect, what does that look like day to day from your perspective?

[USER]
People who treat each other fairly, allowing everyone to have a voice and not showing any discrimination.

[ASSISTANT]
And when you talk about being free to work without being monitored constantly, what does that look like in practice for you?

[USER]
Being allowed to plan my own work schedule subject to priorities  of course. Not having a manager who likes to micro manage every single little thing.

[ASSISTANT]
Of the things you mentioned, which matters most to you and why?

[USER]
Not having a manager that micro manages as I feel it is too over bearing and not allowing an individual to grow or feel they are trusted

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
We are in the early phases of AI implementation we have started using co pilot for some of work to help with getting some tasks done quicker. In this case helping with coding solutions

[ASSISTANT]
In that coding example, can you tell me about a recent solution you were building, and what parts Copilot generated versus what you ended up writing yourself?

[USER]
I asked copilot how I would go about creating a script that did a specific task using the python programming language and it generated an example. I then further refined it through prompta and went to test it. I had to tweak the script slightly to make it work more for my purposes

[ASSISTANT]
What exactly did you end up tweaking in the script, and how did you figure out that those were the changes you needed?

[USER]
There were certain parts of the script that didn't work exactly as intended. It was through a combination or error logs and testing

[ASSISTANT]
When the script wasn’t working and you were going through the logs and tests, what went through your mind, and how did you react in the moment?

[USER]
Frustration to a certain point as it should work but didn't initially. Getting a little annoyed looking through the script trying to figure out which bit wasn't working

[ASSISTANT]
After you got it working the way you needed, what stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
It shows that AI can be helpful in the work place in this setting if used correctly

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to writing that script from scratch without Copilot, how did your process and timing change?

[USER]
My timings were much faster as I didn't have to go away and look up a number of steps. I still had to refine the script and test it if course. It gave me an initial outline to start with helping save time

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that task?

[USER]
Used it towards other pieces of work or further working on the script to make it better

[ASSISTANT]
How did using Copilot affect your confidence in the final script, and why?

[USER]
Initially I wasn't very confident it wouldn't work well or it was very efficient code as it was my first time using it like this. Overall I was impressed and started thinking about how we can utilise it more for at least coding work

[ASSISTANT]
When Copilot suggests code, how do you decide what to trust and what to double-check?

[USER]
I ultimately trust the code at least to start with to see if it at least runs which I can then at least refine it

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific mistake or limitation you noticed in Copilot’s suggestions, and how you handled it?

[USER]
It often needs very specific prompts to get you the right answer you want or at least a number of separate prompts together to get what you want

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond coding, has it changed any other parts of your tech support work so far?

[USER]
It's also good for querying technical issues for ideas as sometimes this can be a long process of guess work

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It has not affected my working relationships for the moment

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Dealing with people directly as when speaking with people this need a certain delicate too at times

[ASSISTANT]
Why is that people-facing piece important for you to keep?

[USER]
It's an important part of my job I like dealing with people whether face to face or over the phone.  I think AI would struggle to deal with this particularly if someone is emotional

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over those conversations, how do you think it would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
I don't think it would change my relationship with my team mates. My role in the team would probably change to a non contact role

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent conversation with a user where the human touch mattered, and what you did in that moment that an AI might have missed?

[USER]
When gathering requirements for a project we also talked about their current situation catching on each other life's making it not just work talk

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily hand over to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Data jobs that can be very fiddly and can consume a lot of time debugging what is wrong with it

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about those fiddly data jobs that makes you want to pass them off, and what would handing them over let you focus on instead?

[USER]
Would let me focus on more customer facing jobs. Although I like the challenge of figuring out the issue if can consume a lot of time

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
That they should have the freedom to be able to do their work without having oversight constantly. This would then allow them to gain valuable experience of independence while having help available if needed. Being able to work independently and plan your work is important in this field as tasks are constantly changing along with competing with each other

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice, maybe from a recent week where you planned your own work and checked in only when needed?

[USER]
We have on going migrations projects to a new platform that I am managing we check in twice a week with each other to see how we are doing and if needs any help or advice

[ASSISTANT]
In one of those migration weeks, can you tell me about a moment when you set your own approach or changed course without waiting for sign-off? What did you do, and what happened next?

[USER]
I was designing a large GiS web application and I had to change the design to make it functional. This required me doing a lot of changes on the backend to make it work if I had waited for approval would have slowed me down. After doing the changes the web application worked much better

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything we haven’t covered about how AI is affecting your work that you’d like to add?

[USER]
There is potential if could replace jobs in the future I suppose but nothing currently

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing all of that. Is there anything else you want to add about AI’s impact on your work?

[USER]
Nothing else

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and thoughtful insights. I appreciate you sharing concrete examples from your work, and I wish you all the best as you continue exploring how these tools fit your role.

Interview 34
Username: 601e028aea41df251254119a
Date: 12/12/2025 19:44:08
Duration: 36.01 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hi! Sure, I work as a Service Desk Analyst

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Good question, work-life balance and feeling like you have autonomy and working with nice people

[ASSISTANT]
When you say work-life balance, what does that look like for you day to day?

[USER]
Having a good rapport and being able to be flexible with my hours if I have an appointment or need to leave early or work from home

[ASSISTANT]
When you say autonomy, what does that mean in your job?

[USER]
Having a bit of say in what I do and how I do it. Some things are quite linear but I am looking at making things better for users which is a choice

[ASSISTANT]
When you say working with nice people, what does that look like in your team or on a typical day?

[USER]
Nobody on my team is nasty, we support eachother, if a phone call comes in 2 minutes before one of us is about to leave, one of us will take it so they can get going on time at the end of the day

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
Good question! It's slowly becoming more of a thing. We now have a Copilot licence for numerous users and many people are using it. I use it if I need to write a quick guide for a user who doesn't know how to do something i.e, changing the email signature or out of office that I don't want to have to type up from scratch

[ASSISTANT]
In that example of writing a quick guide, which parts did Copilot handle and which parts did you do yourself?

[USER]
Copilot writes the steps and being a Microsoft product, I trust it to get that fairly right. I then format it after copying the text to make it look less AI and tweak it to be more understandable if necessary

[ASSISTANT]
Has it ever gotten the steps wrong or left something important out, and if so, what did you do in that situation?

[USER]
It gave me instructions for the wrong version of Word. I also had to get screenshots and tweak some of the phrasing to make it a bit easier for people who aren't as tech savvy

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized it was the wrong version, what went through your mind and how did you react in the moment?

[USER]
It was annoying. It meant having to specify to Copilot to base it on another version (I meant Outlook btw, sorry - we use classic Outlook as new Outlook is terrible and doesn't work with out plug-ins). Luckily it didn't get sent to the user this time, but I'm sure it will happen

[ASSISTANT]
Catching it before sending, how did that shape your confidence about using Copilot the next time?

[USER]
Reminds me to double check as AI isn't perfect!

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to writing those guides yourself from scratch, how does the process and time differ when you use Copilot?

[USER]
Writing from scratch takes me 10-15 minutes, depending on what it is. It's phrasing it etc - it saves so much time. Copilot is done in seconds. When writing guides, the nature of our job is that we have to take phone calls and I get interrupted when focusing a lot

[ASSISTANT]
When Copilot saves you those minutes, what do you usually do with that time instead?

[USER]
Work on other user's problems and clear some more support tickets

[ASSISTANT]
Besides writing quick guides, are there other ways it’s showing up in your day?

[USER]
I see it a lot. I can tell when text has been written by AI - the long hyphens, commas before and in lists#

[ASSISTANT]
When you spot text that looks AI written, how does that change how you handle the request or the person who sent it, if at all?

[USER]
I've seen it a few times. Kinda sad as it's like people can't be bothered but then when I think about it, it makes sense. I would worry about it not conveying issues though

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time when a message you think was AI‑written didn’t capture the real issue, and what happened next?

[USER]
I can't think of anything specific

[ASSISTANT]
On a busy day when you’re juggling calls and tickets, what stands out to you about using Copilot compared to how those days felt before?

[USER]
It makes things easier being able to fire back a guide on things that sometimes shouldn't have been tickets :)

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re reviewing and tweaking Copilot’s draft, what does that work feel like for you?

[USER]
Slightly frustrating sometimes but mostly relieved that I'm not having to think about how to word a guide or reply with instructions on doing something basic

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I don't think it has. Or at least, we don't use it in a way it would. They've been hot on the policy across the business about how to use it.

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned the policy. What does it ask you to do or avoid, and has that changed how you communicate with colleagues or users?

[USER]
Just in terms of not sharing sensitive data, not signing in so that Copilot doesn't learn from sensitive data - that kind of thing

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
probably the actual troubleshooting. Sometimes you need to show a user in person and have a human reassure them about something, particularly those who are less savvy with tech

[ASSISTANT]
Why is doing the troubleshooting yourself, and being there in person to reassure someone, important for you to keep?

[USER]
The human aspect. People will always, always need that.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over the troubleshooting, how do you think that would change your relationships with users or your role on the team?

[USER]
Good question! I think my job would be in trouble - depending on what aspects it was going to take over

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent time when being there in person changed the outcome or shifted a user’s mindset?

[USER]
Being able to not make them feel stupid but also in-person - a majority of people prefer it. Being able to explain something as a human is something an AI can't do.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Haha! GREAT question. Typing out ther user's laptop ID and location each time - would be nice if it could do the typing from the phone call and pick up the key points to log a ticket. Having to troubleshoot remotely while talking on the phone is really hard

[ASSISTANT]
What makes that note taking during calls the right fit to hand off?

[USER]
It's a task that AI would be good for - summarising and catching key details. It's hard to actively listen if I am remoted over and looking at the problem. AI doing the fully active part to discern the actual need to know info would be good

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled that note taking during calls, how do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team, if at all?

[USER]
I don't think it would. As long as I took in the notes that the AI took and processed it as necessary, I think the others would want to be using it too!

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I mean, this may be really specific to me as a neurodivergent person (as mentioned, doing more than one thing at once is really hard) but being able to step back a bit if needed and decide when to WFH is really important

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from a recent week when you stepped back or chose to work from home, and what you decided on your own versus what you needed to clear with your manager?

[USER]
I woke up after a very busy day in the office the previous day and texted my manager to say that I would start the day from home and then go from there. It's a good place to be in.

[ASSISTANT]
When you decide it’s time to step back or start from home, what cues tell you it’s needed, and how do you communicate that so your team stays aligned?

[USER]
I get overwhelmed and can't cope being around people. Masking is exhausting. I let my team know and we all stay in contact via Teams anyway

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of a decision you made about how to handle a ticket or a user interaction that reflects that kind of deciding for yourself?

[USER]
Extra good question. I delay calling some users. I do the starter tickets from home so I can focus as the process is quite long.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
Nothing I can think of. I'm concerned for the future with the way companies like Palantir and co are operating, particularly when the US, UK, Australia and the EU are all pushing for more surveillance and control. It's quite frightening as I do believe it will probably affect my work a lot more someday

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing that. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
nothing obvious I don't think - still early days with it all but a scary pace, nonetheless

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Interview 35
Username: 6413bee5234ad46e9fc4ba75

Duration: 53.13 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
How much longer that I would still have a job and felt really bad for a lot of my friends and coworkers who just were gone

[ASSISTANT]
That sounds like a really tough period. Could you tell me what your role is and what your day to day looked like around that time?

[USER]
Strictly speaking I'm web developer but for about 6 years I've been what they have called me is a technical lead which I lima lead a team of six which includes a few web developers a keyway and a screwmaster

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. What does leading that team involve for you on a typical day?

[USER]
Sorry that should say scrum master. But yes we have several meetings each week talking about the types of things that we're all doing and going to be doing and I have code reviews with them and we disseminate work

[ASSISTANT]
I appreciate you clarifying, and thanks for walking me through your routine. In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
For me it is being able to use one's skills and getting paid a decent wage and having an employer who cares about your well-being be it physical or career etc and just having that work life balance that everybody talks about

[ASSISTANT]
Of the things you mentioned, which one matters most to you right now, and why?

[USER]
For me it's the work-life balance aspect because while I do appreciate the salary and that is something I don't want to go away what's really important is spending time with my family

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about a healthy week, what does that balance look like in practice for you?

[USER]
Well I work a hybrid schedule so I'm able to work from home a little bit and that allows me to pop in and out sometimes to help kids with their homework and things like this but I also want to be able to collaborate and have relationships with my teammates too

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
For me AI is both exciting and a little scary. The problem is that we started our company out with copilot for everybody to use however they want to use it and that was rolled out to everybody really quick. Now there are other tools we are allowing rolling out like quad code and cursor but it isn't a limited fashion so not everybody has access to them right away. So right now the impact is slower than I'd like it to be but it still is very useful in allowing me to learn concepts and skills that I don't understand or don't have

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used one of these tools on a specific piece of work? What was the task, and how did you use the tool step by step?

[USER]
Well a lot of my teammates are using Claude code and cursor right now but I don't have access yet unbelievably. So I still rely on Microsoft co-pilot both as a chatbot but also inside visual studio. Anyway my team has a lot of front-end developers but a little bit back and as well. But most recently we have been charged with improving SEO. Not only in terms of how fast the page loads but in terms of content and working with the marketing team and the content editors and everything. So I've been using Microsoft co-pilot along with our scrum Master to churn out a plan to figure out how to improve our SEO and AEO and GEO and all the O's

[ASSISTANT]
In that SEO planning example, what parts did Copilot actually produce, and what parts did you and your scrum master create yourselves?

[USER]
We are very open and new to SEO in terms of marketing and content. We are more experts in page speed and things to do with lighthouse reports. So we were just ideating in brainstorming and both my scrum master and I did this separately. We fed it what our basic goals were and then we asked AI what types of things that we would need to do to achieve those goals we gave it as much context as we could in terms of what our business was and the types of contact that we had out there already

[ASSISTANT]
When Copilot gave you those suggestions, what did you keep and act on, and what did you set aside?

[USER]
What we did is that we each came up with sort of a battle plan and mine was more from a technical side of things and hers was more from what she had heard from marketing. We ended up combining them noting which goals were higher priorities and which ones we had already accomplished and which ones we were not going to worry about right away. Some of it may no sense for us but other parts made a lot of sense and it helped us sort of formulate how and when we were going to move forward. And then we took all that and created a notion doc from it

[ASSISTANT]
Were there any suggestions from Copilot that were off base or just not workable for your context, and how did you handle those?

[USER]
Yes some were definitely off base and I was able to sort of call those out as being either nonsensical or not appropriate to our business case. What ended up happening was that the scrum Masters document was very fluffy and a lot of noise and we had to spend a lot of time going about eliminating things that she thought sounded great but just did not apply to our case

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized a lot of it was fluff or not a fit, what went through your mind, and how did you approach the conversation with your scrum master about trimming it down?

[USER]
Well I was open to ideas and acting on things that I had previously thought of before but I also wanted to make sure that we didn't spend all of our time burning new things but instead that we actually accomplished some low-hanging fruit tasks quickly and made our marketing partners and others happy and we sort of iterated on the document and kept a few things around to think about later

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to doing this kind of planning before these tools were around, how did the process and the pace feel different this time?

[USER]
The process felt more rushed and well there were less people in the room. Because a number of them had been let go or left. So part of it was that we are listening to podcasts and during doing research and querying AI about what we can do for SEO and AEO but there are more let's just say non-technical people that are producing these documents and that they just expect you to do work from this AI output almost like a CEO might hand you a mock-up of a website and say just build it when there are gaps in technical details so it feels a little rushed and a little bit flimsy

[ASSISTANT]
When you get one of those AI‑generated docs from a non‑technical colleague, what do you do first to turn it into something you can actually build?

[USER]
Firstly I remove as many emoticons I can but I also try to boil it down into things that are technically feasible

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used Copilot inside Visual Studio on an actual coding task? What were you trying to build, and how did you use or modify its suggestions?

[USER]
Well my main application right now is a.net framework 4.8 that has code that is up to 15 years old. So I haven't actually found co-pilot within visual studio that useful. This is code that I've lived with for all these years and while I have experimented with it hasn't produced results that made me any more productive. If anything it can help me with syntax and sort of autocomplete type things but I'm not yet at a point where I can rewrite entire application in a different language or something like that

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time when Copilot actually helped you learn or crack something you were stuck on? What was the moment it clicked, and what did you do next?

[USER]
Well it can help with things like the vulnerable code and security issues. I'm not a security expert at all so I can give it some code and it can help me identify where there is a vulnerability either in my code or some related library and it can explain terms very quickly and in fact much more quickly than it would take me to look them up old school and Google or stack overflow

[ASSISTANT]
When it flagged a vulnerability, what steps did you take to check whether it was right before making any changes?

[USER]
Any code whether it's generated by AI or not falls under a review process with my peers so there is that at the base level but then when there is a security risk we also bring in a security reviewer as well and they sign off on it and sometimes I never really know on my own if something is truly fixed so it helps to have that purity process in place

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
That is a really good question. I think that it has both hurt and helped. It has helped because more people are stepping up to innovate and contribute and so there is more collaboration. On the other hand everybody thinks that they're an expert and it can be a little bit overwhelming and can put a little bit of a strain on those relationships

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent moment when these tools clearly improved collaboration on your team? What happened, and what stands out to you about it?

[USER]
Well I think that the AI itself didn't improve collaboration it was just that it gave us more to talk about. So it wasn't like we said hey I hey I said to do this and let's do this it was hey we have our own ideas AI has these ideas and it just sort of promoted more discussion and it allowed a number of people to speak up that maybe wouldn't have spoken up before

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time when these tools created strain or tension with a colleague or stakeholder? What happened, and how did you handle it?

[USER]
Well it is definitely uncomfortable with my scrum master because she is high energy and likes to encourage us to get things done which is fine except for she will hear request from a stakeholder put it in AI crank out a document that is not necessarily technically sound and say go do this and you can do that by Friday right? When it may not be something that can be done for three Fridays from now it's hard to have the conversation about it with her because she is well meeting and don't want to put her down in any way

[ASSISTANT]
In that moment when she handed you the doc and a tight deadline, what did you say or do to reset the scope or the timeline?

[USER]
Well fortunately we didn't promise her anything about when we would get it done she would just ask us what our progress was and then try to explain to her what we had done and what we still had to do in any blockers that we had and it's kind of live with her asking and asking. We just get it done when we get it done

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I like the little maintenance tasks and one off tasks that people ask me to do that they do because maybe at the last one of the company that was having to do it. I don't think AI could ever replace some of these custom ad hoc legacy tasks. If it could I would be sad because I really enjoy doing that

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those ad hoc legacy tasks satisfying for you to keep doing yourself rather than handing them to a tool?

[USER]
Well I don't know that a tool be at AI or not could do some of these things. Basically the folds are using a tool but then there's one or two things that they can't or won't do that I know how to do and it just makes me feel useful and it really type of thing or these are types of things that would not be worth modifying and we're adding AI to anyway

[ASSISTANT]
If a tool did take over those ad hoc legacy tasks, how do you think that would change your role on the team or your relationships with the folks who ask you for help?

[USER]
Well if it did as you say then I would probably have less relationships with people

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Well part of it is taking notes and meetings and forming action items and we already do that with AI but it is just not very good at it so it is not useful at all if it were useful I would love it

[ASSISTANT]
When you say the meeting notes and action items aren’t very good yet, what typically goes wrong in them?

[USER]
Well the two major tools that we use in that regard right now are zoom meetings and slack puddles. Slack is a little better than zoom but it did not understand the context enough to know that next item is suggesting is not real. It just doesn't get it quite right. The summaries are a little better as to what was said but the action item aren't so you can't have a list of 10 action items were set of been of them are bad seven of them are bad

[ASSISTANT]
If the notes and action items were accurate and reliable, how would that change how you run meetings or what you do right after them?

[USER]
Yes 100% it would. We could turn these action items into work tickets for example and just streamline a lot of things

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
The biggest thing right now I feel is that at my company and a lot of companies we have the ability to innovate and move up the ladder by thinking in ways that are new and useful and can make the company money and really AI I feel levels to playing field for people in my role but in a lot of rules because it gives them easier access to powerful tools

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your own job where you had that kind of freedom to try a new idea, and what you actually did?

[USER]
Well right now it is the SEO example that I gave earlier. I am no SEO expert at all. We got rid of the director of SEO or whatever he was called 6 months ago and now for some reason this falls to my team. So we are expected to learn and do very quickly these things that this other person did. So we just as I mentioned brainstormed and came up with you with a few action items and just experimented basically in production and try to determine if that improved our SEO which is difficult to do actually

[ASSISTANT]
In your current role, what is a concrete decision you can make on your own without checking with someone else?

[USER]
Well I am sort of a gatekeeper of code going to production so well and I also have yours of experience on my particular application so I am able to push certain things to production without going through QA as long as they don't break any security guard rails we have in place.

[ASSISTANT]
For that young person, how would they know they truly have it—what could they decide on their own, and what responsibilities would come with that?

[USER]
I would say if they have to ask if they have it or not then they don't have it. But if you are good at what you do and you are comfortable with the risk then you will probably be rewarded for those responsibilities that will come with that.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t talked about?

[USER]
I think we've covered it all today thank you.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

[USER]

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I’m a data analyst. I work with numbers, reports, and trends to help my organization make better decisions. My job is to turn raw data into clear, useful insights

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job offers fair pay, steady hours, and clear expectations. It gives people respect, chances to grow, and work that feels useful. It also provides an environment where employees feel supported, safe, and able to balance life and work..

[USER]
A good job for me as a data analyst,  is one where my work feels useful, my skills are valued and I'm well paid fairly

[ASSISTANT]
Of everything you mentioned, which two or three matter most to you, and why do those rise to the top?

[USER]
The most important thing to me are fair pay, meaningful work and clear expectations.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say meaningful work and clear expectations, can you tell me about a recent project that fit those for you and what made it feel that way?

[USER]
I recently worked on a dashboard project analyzing customer churn. It felt meaningful because leadership used my insights to change outreach strategies.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI impacts my work by helping me process large datasets faster and spot patterns I might miss manually. It can automate routine tasks like cleaning data or generating reports, which frees me to focus on deeper analysis and more strategic, decision-driving insights.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the last time you used AI to clean a dataset. What did it do, and what did you handle yourself?

[USER]
The last time I used AI to clean a dataset, it automatically identified missing values, standardized formats, and flagged duplicates. I handled the context-specific decisions myself, like deciding which rows to keep or remove, adjusting outliers, and ensuring the cleaned data matched the project goals.

[USER]
Last time I used AI to clean a dataset, it automatically identified missing values, standardized formats, and flagged duplicates. I handled the context-specific decisions myself, like deciding which rows to keep or remove and ensuring the cleaned data matched the project goals.

[ASSISTANT]
In that session, did it make any mistakes or questionable calls, and if so, how did you catch and handle them?

[USER]
The AI sometimes flagged unusual but valid entries as errors, like rare customer codes. I caught these by cross-checking against the source data and patterns I knew were legitimate, then manually corrected or restored them to ensure the dataset stayed accurate.

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when you saw those valid entries being flagged?

[USER]
I felt cautious because it reminded me that AI can be helpful but still miss context. I knew I had to double‑check things myself, trust my own judgment.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent time you used AI to generate a report, step by step from start to finish?

[USER]
Sure. Recently, I generated a monthly sales performance report using AI. First, I uploaded the raw sales data and defined the metrics I wanted, like revenue by region and top-selling products. Then, the AI cleaned the data, summarized trends, and created charts. I reviewed the output, checked for errors or unusual spikes, and adjusted labels or explanations as needed. Finally, I added context from my own analysis, wrote a short narrative, and shared the polished report with my team.

[ASSISTANT]
When AI handled parts of that monthly report, what did you do with the time you didn’t spend on cleaning and charting?

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I checked that the code was wired up to the rest of the codebase correctly, and that default unit tests had been generated, and ran successfully

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I think we already covered that, but I'll recap, feeling like you enjoy what you do, and that the environment is supportive

[ASSISTANT]
When you say the environment is supportive, what does that look like in practice for you?

[USER]
as I said before, that colleagues are friendly and non-judgemental, and leadership does not micromanage

[ASSISTANT]
When you say you enjoy what you do, what parts of a typical workday make it enjoyable for you?

[USER]
analysing the problem I'm working on, and developing a solution

[ASSISTANT]
Is there anything else you’d add to that list of what makes a job good?

[USER]
good benefits

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI helps me by doing all the repetitive boring bits, and by acting as my assistant

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent task where it acted as your assistant, and what the task was?

[USER]
I asked AI to solve a unit test failure

[ASSISTANT]
In that case, what did you give it to work with, and what did it give back to you?

[USER]
I use an AI that is integrated into my IDE, so it has access to my project

[ASSISTANT]
Walk me through what happened after you saw the failing test—what did you do, and what did the AI do?

[USER]
once I was unable to determine why the test was failing, I asked AI to explain why the failure was occurring, it provided me with a step by step analysis of the test, and pointed out an issue that I had overlooked

[ASSISTANT]
What exactly did it single out in the code or the test, and what steps did you take after that?

[USER]
it pointed out that I was calling some code asynchronously, and the result was not being captured by the test. I change the code to be wrapped synchronously and that resolved the problem

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when it highlighted the async call you’d missed?

[USER]
embaressment

[ASSISTANT]
After that experience, did it change anything about how you approach debugging tests?

[USER]
not really no

[ASSISTANT]
Did using it make you feel more confident in the fix, or did you find yourself double‑checking more than usual?

[USER]
it made me more confident that the test in question worked

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to fixing that kind of failing test without it, how did the time and effort compare for you this time?

[USER]
it probably saved me 10-15 minutes that I would have wasted diagnosing it myself

[ASSISTANT]
Has it ever given you an explanation or fix that turned out to be wrong, and if so, how did you handle that?

[USER]
yes often, but that's often down to me not constructing my prompt with enough details

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
it makes me less dependant on asking my colleagues to assist me

[ASSISTANT]
What has that shift been like for you—feeling less dependent on colleagues—does it change how you interact with them day to day?

[USER]
I interact with them less

[ASSISTANT]
What has it been like for you to interact less with them?

[USER]
fantastic

[ASSISTANT]
What about interacting less feels fantastic to you?

[USER]
my current colleagues are morons

[ASSISTANT]
Has it changed anything in how your manager or clients see your work, or how you communicate with them?

[USER]
no, AI has no bearing on those interactions

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future, is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
gathering, analysing and estimating requirements

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you want to keep gathering, analyzing, and estimating requirements in your own hands rather than delegate those to an AI?

[USER]
interaction with stakeholders

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about those conversations with stakeholders that you want to keep doing yourself?

[USER]
that's how you understand the business domain

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over requirements work, how do you think it would change your relationships with stakeholders or your role on the team?

[USER]
I would be divorced from understanding why we are delivering a project

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
all documentation work

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up documentation work?

[USER]
because I don't like writing

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled documentation, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
it would make me look more productive and professional

[ASSISTANT]
If AI were doing the documentation, what parts would you want it to handle end to end, and what would you still want to review yourself?

[USER]
I would let it generate all the documentation, but I would want to have final cut

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them to master the job without AI before using it

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of a time when learning it the hard way first changed how you later used AI on the same kind of task?

[USER]
I can't say

[ASSISTANT]
When you say master the job without AI, what would you want them to be able to do on their own before they start using AI?

[USER]
learn the basics of software development

[ASSISTANT]
When you say the basics, what would be on that checklist for a junior developer in your view?

[USER]
algorithms, design patterns, understanding the platform sdk

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work before we wrap up?

[USER]
nope

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work as a data scientist

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
The important characteristics for me are: a good work/life balance, good pay, friendly colleagues, job security, and good career progression opportunities.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for laying those out. Of the things you mentioned, which two matter most to you right now, and why?

[USER]
good work/life balance and good pay. The first is important to me to because i want to have time for my hobbies outside of work such as playing and watching football. The second is important because I would like to buy a house in the future.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say good balance, what does that look like in a typical week for you?

[USER]
Not having to work overtime any day of the week.

[ASSISTANT]
And when you think about good pay, what tells you it’s good in your context?

[USER]
That i am able to save a reasonable amount of money each month, maybe around £400

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I wouldn't say AI has impacted the output of my work much, but it has changed my working process. Nowadays, instead of performing a google search or reading documentation I often use chatgpt to find the information much quicker.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used ChatGPT instead of searching or reading docs—what were you trying to figure out, step by step?

[USER]
I wanted to plot a heatmap of same data using matplotlib in python. I needed to know what format should the data be in and which functions should I use to plot the data. I also wanted to know how can I customise the plot.

[ASSISTANT]
In that heatmap example, what exactly did you ask ChatGPT, and what did you do with the response once you got it?

[USER]
I asked ChatGPT `how to plot a heatmap with python and matplotlib`. It gave me a code example which I copied in to my program and made a couple of changes for it to work with my data.

[ASSISTANT]
Did the example run as-is, or did you hit any errors or odd results that you had to sort out?

[USER]
I had to make changes for it to work because it was missing the context of my work. But the code example was correct.

[ASSISTANT]
In that heatmap case, which parts felt like the tool did the heavy lifting, and which parts were yours to figure out or refine?

[USER]
It felt like the tool did the heavy lifting with finding which functions I need to use. I had to change the name of some variables for it to work with my data and I had to decide some stylistic features such as the colour of the heatmap and the title of the plot.

[ASSISTANT]
When you worked that way, what went through your mind about relying on ChatGPT instead of digging through docs—did anything about that switch stand out to you?

[USER]
I think it was better at providing examples of how I can use the code. Sometimes documentation is too technical. I also enjoyed that I could always use a consistent user interface.

[ASSISTANT]
Did using it in that moment make you feel more confident about the plot you produced, or less? What led you to that reaction?

[USER]
Not really. I would have been able to get to the same result without chathpt, it would have just taken me longer.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved by using it for the heatmap?

[USER]
I'm not sure. I just continued working after and I got more work done.

[ASSISTANT]
Have you run into cases where it gave you the wrong or outdated info, and if so, how did you handle it in the moment?

[USER]
Yes, it has given me wrong answers many times. I try to avoid asking overly technical questions which I cannot quickly verify my self. Recently it gave me some code which had a line missing. I was able to spot this quickly and fix it myself. It was not a big issue

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond quick coding questions, are there other parts of your job where you use it, like scoping work, writing, analysis choices, or anything else?

[USER]
No, I want to keep my work human and not sound like chatgpt

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It has not really affected them

[ASSISTANT]
Have you noticed colleagues or your manager using or talking about these tools, and if so, what kinds of conversations have come up around them?

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Yes, I am in upper management in software engineering, and I also run a small business

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Good pay, good work (tasks, processes) and good benefits

[ASSISTANT]
When you say good work in terms of tasks and processes, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
Work that is interesting, challenging and doesn’t burn you out. It strikes that balance between boredom/uselessness and burnout

[ASSISTANT]
When you’ve had to make tradeoffs in the past, which of those matters most to you and why?

[USER]
Challenges, because they are usually the ones that correlate the most with compensation.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think of good benefits, which ones make the biggest difference for you and why?

[USER]
Holidays (PTO) and personal development allowances, because I need time to both rest and to improve my skills in a structured way

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It makes some tasks easier, and faster, but also adds to my plate in terms of revising my reports’ work that they do with AI (so it has more mistakes than usual)

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent task where AI was involved, and walk me through what happened?

[USER]
Yes, recently I asked for a recently hired report to code a prototype, and they delivered mainly AI slop. It made me sad, disappointed and a little angry

[ASSISTANT]
I hear the mix of sadness, disappointment, and anger in that. In that prototype, which parts looked like they came straight from the tool, and which parts showed the new hire’s own thinking?

[USER]
There was very little of a human’s own thinking there. Let’s say 90-10%

[ASSISTANT]
What were the most concrete problems you saw in that prototype?

[USER]
There were many hallucinations there, that my report didn’t really understand and just left there, which made the whole thing a bit like Frankenstein’s monster. It did what it was supposed to do, and was admirable in certain regards, but it was slow and clumsy

[ASSISTANT]
After you saw that version, what did you do next with your report to address those issues?

[USER]
I had to convince (in exchange for an opportunity at a prestigious project) a more senior colleague of theirs to go and pair program the thing with then

[ASSISTANT]
During that pairing session, what did the senior colleague keep from the original and what did they rewrite or build from scratch?

[USER]
I think they scraped more than half of its . Like I said, it was clunky and somewhat useless.

[ASSISTANT]
When you first realized it was mostly tool output, what went through your mind about your expectations for this hire and how you’d need to support them?

[USER]
I know this hire has the skills required to perform, and at a very good level at that, because they passed a number of in-person skills and personality assessments, in addition to their experience in academia. But the problem is that AI is a machete, not a scalpel, and they need to understand that (no offense to you or other artificial beings)

[ASSISTANT]
That machete image makes sense. Can you tell me about a task where you personally use AI, and walk me through how you approach it step by step?

[USER]
Yes, I use AI to review both my work and that of my reports. I use it as a second pair of eyes. But I’m always I control, and aware of what’s happening. I criticize it’s input, I ask why, I prod

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking of the last time you used it as a second pair of eyes, what did you keep from its suggestions and what did you reject, and why?

[USER]
Just this morning I was looking at a PRD (know what it is), and making notes on it, and I brainstormed some very good points with AI (maybe like 60-70%), I was happy with it

[ASSISTANT]
In that PRD session, what kinds of suggestions did you discard, and what tipped you off that they weren’t right?

[USER]
Nothing was extremely wrong, but there were a couple of things that didn’t really sit right, as if the AI didn’t really understand it. When it starts using too much purple prose, you know it’s trying to compensate. Sadly, everything is under NDA

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Please clarify

[ASSISTANT]
I mean how using these tools has changed how you interact with your teammates, your boss, or clients. Can you tell me about a recent interaction where that change was noticeable?

[USER]
Well for starters I can say that I use AI to edit about 90% of my written communication. But not too many style/tone editions

[ASSISTANT]
Can you think of a specific email or Slack message you edited with AI recently and tell me what you changed, and how the other person responded?

[USER]
I mean, also this morning I wrote a message to my team’s channel outilining the end-of-year rotation for on-call shifts, and the AI helped me make the final decision, by going through schedules and staff information (skills, preferences)

[ASSISTANT]
What response did you get from the team after you posted that rotation, and what stands out to you about that exchange?

[USER]
I’ve already seen some notifications suggesting some modifications, but I haven’t been able to act on them.

[ASSISTANT]
When you handle those modification requests, how will you decide what to change, and will you bring the tool back in for that or rely on your own judgment?

[USER]
I haven’t thought that far ahead. I supposed I’ll just try to cater to everyone’s prefer schedules and, in case of conflict, I’ll suggest they work it out among themselves

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about your team, has your use of these tools changed how people see your role or how they come to you for decisions?

[USER]
I don’t think so. I’m still the same, only leadership has put much more on everyone’s plate, including mine

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
If AI can do it perfectly, then it won’t be up to me to choose, will it?

[ASSISTANT]
Setting aside whether that day ever comes, is there a part of your work you’d still want to keep doing yourself because it matters to you to do it personally?

[USER]
Coaching my reports.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is coaching something you want to keep doing yourself? What is it about those conversations or moments that you wouldn’t want a tool to handle?

[USER]
Because I am human and so are they. We are very nuanced, so common yet so different from each other. But I really like to find the one thing where we click on (there is always one) and leverage it to help them grow

[ASSISTANT]
If a tool tried to handle those coaching conversations, how do you think it would change your relationships with your team?

[USER]
Would the too pretend to be me?

[ASSISTANT]
Imagine it didn’t pretend to be you, but sat in the background to prep you with questions, patterns, or reminders. What role, if any, would you be comfortable with it playing in those coaching conversations?

[USER]
Then it wouldn’t be the same. My reports know I’d go to war for them

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Office politics. Knowing what leadership and other members of upper management are after, and trying to find common ground that advances all parties’ interests

[ASSISTANT]
What makes that the thing you’d want to hand over first?

[USER]
It’s too complicated, too many moving parts, sometimes it requires emotional labor

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over that office politics work, how do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
Not much, if at all. I rather walk than talk

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
That’s a tricky one. I’d say something to the effect of “To be able to have a say on what you work on, how you do it, when and, if you’re very lucky, why”

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your current role where you did have that say over what, how, or when, and tell me how it played out?

[USER]
Sure. Unless in very specific  cases (like when I required one  report to pair program with the new hire), I like to think both me and my team have some degree of autonomy, defined in those terms. Because we also work on a hybrid schedule, I would also add “from where”

[ASSISTANT]
In that pairing case, what tradeoffs did you weigh and how did you decide it was worth stepping in rather than letting the new hire keep iterating alone?

[USER]
They needed to be shown how to use AI, and sometimes the best way to do it is, paradoxically, with someone pointing and clicking in front of you. I think it worked.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say having a say over why, what does that actually look like in your team on a real project?

[USER]
That’s more related to what organization you look for, and their purpose. Not a lot to do with teams.

[ASSISTANT]
If someone on your team wanted to tell whether they truly have that kind of say versus just lip service, what signs would you tell them to look for in day-to-day work?

[USER]
How much I micromanage their work, or get them sidetracked

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t touched on yet?

[USER]
I am afraid that I’m going to olhe replaced, sooner rather than later, and that adds to my cognitive load

[ASSISTANT]
I hear that concern, and thank you for saying it out loud. Is there anything else you’d like to add about how these tools are affecting your work, or shall we wrap up here?

[USER]
No, we can wrap up

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hi there, I am the chief information officer in a large retail operation

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I think a good job is something that is both challenging and rewarding. Whilst actually giving a genuine sense of satisfaction at the end of the day.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say challenging, what kinds of challenges do you have in mind?

[USER]
A test your wills. You have to actually think and use a lot of effort to achieve your goals.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say rewarding, what makes it feel that way for you at the end of a workday?

[USER]
Definitely if you have hit the criteria that has been sent out for you whilst going above and beyond you walk away just knowing that you have made a difference both of the organisation and the wider customer base

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond challenge and feeling you’ve made a difference, what else matters most to you in a good job?

[USER]
Two things one is a good work life balance. In my humble opinion, one doesn’t work without the other. But also, this may be somewhat to boo but it has to be a good rate to pay. Nobody wants to feel like they aren’t being rewarded for their valuable time and expertise.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It definitely has a difference in all core areas. When dealing with customers, their information in every area is vital for making strategic decisions. But we also use it for marketing, customer service, streamlining operations, image and text generation, warehousing and transformation.

[ASSISTANT]
Could you walk me through one recent time you used it, step by step, so I can see exactly what you did and what the system did?

[USER]
I was tasked with coding and creating a new database for gathering and storing customer card abandonment rates. I used AEI two check the coding and generate suggestions on how it may be improved and implemented cost-effectively

[ASSISTANT]
In that project, what parts did you write yourself, and what parts came from the tool’s suggestions?

[USER]
I wrote all of the coding myself however I had it check that it all would operate smoothly and I did take on suggestions for the condensation

[ASSISTANT]
When you say condensation, what do you mean by that in the context of your code?

[USER]
It was able to streamline the flow and take out unnecessary code that did the same job

[ASSISTANT]
Did it make any suggestions you decided not to follow, or anything it got wrong? If so, what tipped you off?

[USER]
There was a few times when a run error would be implemented. Which I had to AutoCorrect myself.

[ASSISTANT]
When you spotted those run errors from the suggestions, what went through your mind and how did you react in the moment?

[USER]
I did think that it shows that AI is potentially subject to errors like any human Tool. But I reacted by calmly seeing where the error originated and updated.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to doing similar coding without using a tool like that, how did your pace and workflow change?

[USER]
It definitely does speed it up. Because it means that if there is a problem with the way the code is running, I can go to each individual component where the error lies, rather than having to go through the whole passage.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that project?

[USER]
Disallowed me to spend some more time with my team. Educating them on future goals of the company. As well as having meetings with the head of department or speaking to vendors/replied to emails et cetera.

[ASSISTANT]
When you work with these tools, what stands out to you about how they affect your confidence in the work you deliver?

[USER]
What really grabs my attention is the efficiency. Also the ability to check data sources in a fraction of an eye. Though prone to error at times. I can pick and choose out of hundreds of collated and curated sources. And then doublecheck the accuracy myself rather than having to do the initial searching.

[ASSISTANT]
Could you tell me about another concrete case, maybe in marketing or customer service, where a tool changed how you did the task, step by step?

[USER]
Definitely a key one is the use of chat bots for helping customer solve issues. The amount of time that we have saved because a customer can effectively contact the chat, And get automatic answers to their queries. Through a table of contents. Before having to contact humans As a last resort.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It’s difficult want to comprehensively pin down. I think I’m one-handed has brought us a lot closer together. These tools allow us to explore potential that we already have. And has brought us together as a team. But on the other hand, I do feel like people can now collaborate independently with a machine rather than having to check in with colleagues.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent moment when it brought your team closer together—what happened and what changed in how you worked together?

[USER]
rather than having to check in with colleagues.

[ASSISTANT]
Think back to a specific meeting where your team used one of these tools together—what happened from start to finish?

[USER]
It was to generate a marketing plan. We had to First sort out data for  products and their needs. Then balance cost-effective way of creation. Before investigating manufacturing cost and timeframe and then the best way to market to customers through videos and visual appeal.

[ASSISTANT]
During that session, how did using the tool change who did what or who had the final say?

[USER]
I think that he kind of gave an open and honest Playing field for everybody. I had the final say as the executive. But everybody could input ideas and use the tool to get the most out of it.

[ASSISTANT]
Have there been any tensions or misunderstandings with colleagues because of these tools?

[USER]
As I’ve said. I think with any tool there is always going to be issues. And I think by taking some humanity away, you will get arguments. Particularly when there are Errors, Which breeds distrust.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
That’s a challenging one. I think I would be very highly reluctant to completely give autonomy to AI when it comes to hiring decisions. I do feel like it is very useful and time saving when it comes to filtering down candidates. But I don’t think that what people have achieved on paper tells the full story about a person and their potential. I think that ultimately it does need the human touch to evaluate what an employee can bring to the table.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is making the final hiring call important for you to keep rather than handing it over?

[USER]
As I already explained. I think that on paper somebody can be an extremely intelligent and high achiever. But lack the person skills to gel  well in a workplace. And just because somebody can be a fantastic coder In a university setting, doesn’t mean that they could handle the high stakes cases of a big business. Where are somebody less qualified on paper? May actually just have a natural attribute towards it.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI made the final hiring call, how do you think that would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
I think that there would be a lot less connectivity on a personal level. I think that you do need to be able to make an emotional attachment with your gut. Not every decision can be made with the head.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily hand over to an AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I think as an executive who must take on a lot of negotiation with vendors and other businesses/heads department I think AI scheduling my meetings and taking notes is something that I wouldn’t have any hesitation over.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes scheduling and note-taking the kind of work you’re comfortable giving up—what’s the appeal of handing those over?

[USER]
It is time-consuming to be able to take notes in particular. Where is an AI assistant can almost 100% accurately dictate into various formats? Any key points that have been made. And when it comes to calendar arrangement. AI can’t scan particular hours days and months to ensure there are no conflicts.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would suggest that it looks like having control over how you do your work. So you can choose any approaches that suit you personally best that still gets the job done. I can choose the tools and my workflows and even how I troubleshoot. I think also being able to creatively solve any problems that I come across. I also feel like that being able to prioritise and manage your own time schedule is a very key one. Like things on how to structure your workday, how long a particular task should take and maybe what needs prioritisation.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a recent concrete day where you exercised that kind of control—what choices did you make about tools, workflow, and what to prioritize?

[USER]
Well, as I said, I think managing your workload is a major one. So recently, my manager told me about needing a deal done with a vendor, running important security logs, responding to heads of department emails. And also reviewing a system for better monitoring. I was allowed to choose the order and aspects of the tasks that I felt I needed to deal with in a particular frame time. Working towards my strength at any point in the day.

[ASSISTANT]
On that day, what did you tackle first, and what went through your mind as you decided the order for the rest?

[USER]
I always have to get my emails done first. Because you don’t know what key information is contained in them. I then will deal with contacting heads of departments and vendors. To arrange follow-up meetings. Just so I know that that is in the bag. And it brings me a level of satisfaction and relief.

[ASSISTANT]
On that day, did you choose any particular tools, AI or otherwise, to handle those tasks, and what guided those choices?

[USER]
As I’ve said. Notetaking is always very important. But also, the use of Grammarly is something that I value very strongly when it comes to emails. I can give my intentions and what I want to say, and it can then convey it in a more professional or hard hitting tone.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work before we wrap up?

[USER]
I think that it is driving us towards a more innovative future. But maybe sometimes at a little bit of an alarming and unsettling pace. Therefore, we do need to ensure that our security and training keep pace. That way we can realise that Ai Is only a force for good.

[ASSISTANT]

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Data analytics manager

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Communication and collaboration

[ASSISTANT]
When you say communication, what does that look like day to day in a job you’d call good?

[USER]
Connection with people to achieve shared goals

[ASSISTANT]
And when you think about collaboration, what makes it work well in practice in a good job?

[USER]
Talking and communicating with people effectively

[ASSISTANT]
Are there any other qualities you’d put alongside those as hallmarks of a good job?

[USER]
The personal touch

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use AI to support my coding and to draft messages

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it to support your coding—what were you trying to do, and which parts did it handle versus what you did yourself?

[USER]
I had a SQL query that wasn’t working. I told AI the problem and gave it the code. It told me I needed a where clause and gave me the solution. I tried the code and it worked as I had wanted. I was very pleased

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind in that moment when the fix worked?

[USER]
I was thrilled. I felt happy it had saved me time and effort

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent time you used it to draft a message—what was the message for, and how did you use or change what it suggested?

[USER]
I needed to send a message to someone I don’t know in order to get access to their data table. It drafted a polite friendly professional message which i just personalised slightly. The person replied in a positive way and i got what I needed. Again, i was super pleased with the AI support

[ASSISTANT]
Has it ever given you something that looked right at first but wasn’t, and what did you do in that situation?

[USER]
Yes. I wanted to know the % make up of a ETF. It was wrong as I compared it to other reputable sources. It corrected itself when I pointed it out but it makes you question other things it says and you feel you need to double check stuff

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on those tasks?

[USER]
I did other things on my list but also had time for things I wanted to do

[ASSISTANT]
How does doing those tasks with AI compare to how you did them before—what’s different in your pace or the way you go about the work now?

[USER]
So much faster. You feel more efficient and better at your job

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It has helped me build better connections as I can write friendlier and more to the point messages

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific interaction where a message you drafted with AI changed how the conversation went, and what stood out to you about that exchange?

[USER]
It changed a message to a friendlier tone than I would have used. The person responded very positively

[ASSISTANT]
After that more positive response, did anything shift in how you and that person worked together afterward?

[USER]
We collaborated more becuse the message helped us build that initial friendly rapport

[ASSISTANT]
Do you usually tell people that you used AI to help with those messages, and if so, how did they react?

[USER]
No, never. I don’t want them to feel less of me, that our interactions are “fake” or that I’m somehow “cheating”….

[ASSISTANT]
When you choose to use it for messages, how, if at all, has that changed what others expect from you?

[USER]
I think people expect a more personable response now. More detailed

[ASSISTANT]
Have you and your team or manager talked about when and how it’s appropriate to use AI for communication or other tasks?

[USER]
No we havent

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
The connections with real people. I would feel isolated and not human if I didn’t get the human touch

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about those person-to-person moments that you most want to keep, especially when you think about AI being involved?

[USER]
It doesn’t understand nuance or humour or real pain the way humans do. It can’t replicate the

[ASSISTANT]
You were about to say “it can’t replicate the…” Could you finish that thought, and tell me about a moment at work when nuance or humor really mattered?

[USER]
It can’t replicate the human touch. It’s a machine so doesn’t understand true feelings

[ASSISTANT]
If those person-to-person moments were handled by AI, how do you think that would change your relationships at work or your role on the team?

[USER]
Yes. I wouldn’t want to work any more. That’s the biggest perk of the job

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
The boring stuff. Admin, meetings I don’t want to attend plus some technical stuff. That would give me more freedom and more time

[ASSISTANT]
When you say the boring stuff, which specific admin tasks or technical pieces would you want it to take over first?

[USER]
Coding and meeting minutes

[ASSISTANT]
What makes coding and meeting minutes the first things you’d want to hand off, and what would you hope that frees you up to do instead?

[USER]
They are technical and just not how I’d choose to spend my time

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Having trust and space to make decisions

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from recently when you were given that trust and space to make a decision at work? What happened?

[USER]
I was leading an analytical piece and my manager let me decide best analytical tool. It was extremely positive to be trusted and I succeeded

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might understand what you said. Do you mean mainly having the freedom to choose the how, like methods and tools, or more the what and why, like defining problems and priorities—or do you mean something else altogether?

[USER]
Yes, I mean that

[ASSISTANT]
If you had to pick, which matters more to you right now—choosing the how, or shaping the what and why?

[USER]
Shaping the what and why

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of this. Is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work before we wrap up?

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Being listened to and getting credit when it is deserved.

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned being listened to and getting credit. Could you tell me about a moment at work when you felt really listened to, or a time when you felt you weren’t? What stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
I raised concerns a concern about unrealistic deadlines, but I was dismissed and my concerns ignored. The plan went ahead as though I hadn't spoken and  the issues I had brought up soon became a problem as I predicted.

[ASSISTANT]
To help me understand the context, what do you do for work, and what was your role in that project with the tight deadlines?

[USER]
I'm a software developer as was working in a team as part of a project.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Enjoying the work and getting a personal sense of accomplishment. Being paid fairly for your time and effort. Getting on with the people you work with and feeling respected.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say feeling respected, what does that look like in the day to day for you? Can you share a recent moment that captures it?

[USER]
Through the most recent project we had clear communication amongst the team and I was listened to. This is very important.

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about enjoying the work and having a sense of accomplishment, what kinds of moments or results in your software work give you that feeling?

[USER]
Moments include when I figure out a tricky bug. When my efforts are valued by my team. When people interact with something I built.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It mainly reduces time spent on repetitive tasks, debugging can become much faster. It leaves me time to be more creative.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used AI to speed up debugging? What was the bug, and how did you use the tool step by step?

Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a software engineer working in health insurance domain.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Core characteristics of a good job is about pressure. There should be no pressure on the employees to complete the work fast.

[ASSISTANT]
Besides the pace and pressure, what else matters to you when you think of a good job?

[USER]
work and life balance

[ASSISTANT]
When you say work and life balance, what does that look like for you in a typical week?

[USER]
40 hours for office work and remaining time should be for family

[ASSISTANT]
Is there anything else that stands out to you when you think of a good job?

[USER]
good salary, job satisfaction, good perks

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI will help in automation of my routine work tasks

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent routine task you automated or are trying to automate, and what the steps look like from start to finish?

[USER]
I have to do data analysis by looking into excel. But AI can help me to do data analysis very quickly

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking of the last time you used AI for an Excel analysis, what question were you trying to answer, and which tool did you use?

[USER]
I want to do sum of all rows in excel. AI helped me to write a formula in excel for this

[ASSISTANT]
In that example with summing rows, what did you have the AI produce, and what parts did you do yourself to get it working in your sheet?

[USER]
AI produced the quick results in pictorial format . AI help me in preparing the presntations

[ASSISTANT]
Walk me through the steps from your data to the AI-generated chart and into the presentation—what did you actually do on your side, and where did you step in to adjust things?

[USER]
I have a data sheet with employee information. AI helped me to derive the complex calculations and formed the pictorial representation of the data. I just did formatting and adjust little things.

[ASSISTANT]
Did the AI miss anything important or make mistakes in those calculations or charts, and if so, how did you handle it?

[USER]
No, AI is clear and I don't see any mistakes.

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind the first time you saw the AI generate those visuals from your employee data?

[USER]
I'm surprised with the AI generated visuals.

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing that analysis with AI compare to how you handled it before, without AI?

[USER]
Before, I have to spend lot of time on those calculations.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved once the AI handled those calculations and visuals?

[USER]
I felt loved and AI saved lot of time.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say you felt loved after saving that time, what about the experience gave you that reaction?

[USER]
Because i can use that free time on other things.

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond Excel and presentations, has AI changed how you write or review code in your day to day work?

[USER]
yes, AI helped me to find me the bugs in my code and helped me to fix it.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about one specific bug where the AI’s suggestion changed how you approached the fix?

[USER]
I have declared a variable outside the for loop and completely forgot about it. AI told me to use the variable inside the for loop. This helps me to write optimized code.

[ASSISTANT]
When the AI pointed out that variable issue, what stood out to you about that moment in terms of your own craft as an engineer?

[USER]
AI looks like a friend who helps the other friend in time of troubles.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
AI helped me to save more time and maintained good working relationships

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent interaction with a colleague or manager where using AI changed how you worked together?

[USER]
My manager encouraged me to include AI in most of the work.

[ASSISTANT]
What did your manager actually ask you to do differently, and how did that change your deadlines or the way your work was reviewed?

[USER]
My manager asked me to do automation of all work tasks with the help of AI.

[ASSISTANT]
When your manager asked you to automate tasks, what changed in your day to day coordination with your team?

[USER]
Day to Day coordination with my team has been changed a lot because of AI.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about one specific meeting or handoff that worked differently after that shift—what actually happened and how did you respond in the moment?

[USER]
Scrum meeting time is reduced because of AI shift.

[ASSISTANT]
In those shorter scrums, what got dropped or sped up, and how did that change how you and your teammates check in with each other?

Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use AI while I code to generate skeleton code, write unit tests, write documentation and comments, summarise unfamiliar code, and perform research

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking of a recent time you used it to generate skeleton code, what did you ask it for, and what did you do next?

[USER]
I asked it to generate a particular type of class used in our project, then I started filling in new custom functionality

[ASSISTANT]
In that instance, what parts did it produce that you kept as is, and what did you change?

[USER]
pretty much all of it

[ASSISTANT]
When you reviewed what it produced, what did you look for before you started adding your own functionality?

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm a manager at a tech company.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I would say job security, fair pay, and always being listened to.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say being listened to, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
If I were to ever have suggestions or complaints they would always be heard by someone above me.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about fair pay, how do you gauge it in your role?

[USER]
I would say getting paid equal to my peers in the same positions.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about job security, what tells you your position is secure in concrete terms?

[USER]
Not being fired without cause.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI has taken over many aspects of my job such as looking for candidates to hire and mass  text entry.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it to look for candidates—what did you do, and what did the AI do?

[USER]
The AI showed me a list of candidates and all I did was choose from these choices.

[ASSISTANT]
What information did you give the system so it could generate that list of candidates?

[USER]
The qualifications for the position I'm looking to fill.

[ASSISTANT]
When it presented the list, what did you look at or check before deciding whom to move forward?

[USER]
I looked through all of the relevant information for the job and picked who I thought was most qualified.

[ASSISTANT]
Has it ever given you candidates who were clearly not a fit, and if so, what did you do in that situation?

[USER]
Actually no. Some have been better qualified but never any with no experience.

[ASSISTANT]
When you first saw the AI’s list and realized you could pick straight from it, what went through your mind?

[USER]
My first thought was this makes my job easier.

[ASSISTANT]
Did using that shortlist change how confident you felt in your hiring decisions, and why?

[USER]
It honestly made me feel relaxed that I wouldn't have to hunt for qualified individuals.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about how you use it for mass text entry—what does the system handle, and what do you handle?

[USER]
There's a lot of paperwork in my job and it's entered into a computer by others and the AI sorts it all.

[ASSISTANT]
Once it’s done sorting, what do you personally do next—do you review or verify anything, and if so, what does that look like?

[USER]
I don't verify anything with this.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to before you had this system, how has your process for handling all that paperwork changed?

[USER]
We used to store all of the same paperwork in filing cabinets.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I would say AI hasn't affected my working relationships at all.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I would say how I supervise my employees, I wouldn't feel comfortable with that.

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about supervising people yourself that feels important to keep in your hands rather than handing it to a system?

[USER]
Because that's the main part of my job.

[ASSISTANT]
If a system took over supervising your team, how do you think it would change your relationships with your employees?

[USER]
I don't think my employees would have as much trust in me.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think of a recent moment of supervising someone that you would never want to hand off, what stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
There are things that my employees tell me that an AI simply wouldn't understand.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Mandatory meetings most definitely.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those meetings the thing you’d gladly hand off—what is it about them that you’d want a system to handle instead of you?

[USER]
They are just so boring and tedious.

[ASSISTANT]
If a system ran those meetings for you, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team? Why or why not?

[USER]
I don't think it would change how they see me because they hate the meetings too.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Being able to make your own choices without anything or anyone else deciding for you.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your job where you made a choice on your own and that captures what you mean?

[USER]
I've hired a candidate that wasn't on the AI  short list before and that felt good.

[ASSISTANT]
What happened after you made that call?

[USER]
Absolutely nothing actually.

[ASSISTANT]
When you chose the candidate who wasn’t on the shortlist, what told you it was the right call—what signals or criteria did you rely on?

[USER]
I feel that my candidate was better suited for the position and I was right.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
There's nothing else I can think of.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Yes it makes mistakes all the time... usually telling it what went wrong it will work through figuring out the correct answer, but there are times where I just give up as I realize it is not capable of giving me what I am looking for

[ASSISTANT]
I hear you. That back-and-forth can be draining, especially when it still can’t get to what you need. To get us oriented, could you tell me a bit about what you do for work?

[USER]
I do a lot of R&D projects - looking for new technologies or solutions to optimize existing products/services or discovering new ideas that can be brought in front of the organizational leaders to see if they would be worth putting actual development time into.  I also do a lot of the devops tasks for the company, creating and maintaining deployment pipelines, managing the github org, kubernetes cluster

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
we already discussed this earlier - I said meaningful work, positive work environment, opportunities for growth

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks. When you say meaningful work, what makes it meaningful to you?

[USER]
can we talk about something else? we already went through this questioning at the beginning of the conversation

[ASSISTANT]
Got it, thanks for letting me know. Let’s shift gears.

Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use AI daily for programming and we have a number of products that were developed pre-genAI using ML to evaluate datasets

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it while coding—what was the specific task you were working on?

[USER]
I used it to try to find an answer on how to access a report property that I could not find in code

[ASSISTANT]
What did you ask it, and what did it give you back in response?

[USER]
I asked it how to find the property I was looking for.  It gave me 3 answers that did not work.  I tried reprompting a few times but was never able to get a correct answer

[ASSISTANT]
When those answers didn’t work, what did you do next to solve it?

[USER]
I did not solve the issue ye, it is still ongoing

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized it still wasn’t giving you a workable answer, what went through your mind?

[USER]
Its annoyingly confident in it's incorrect answers, making me waste time trying each one only to find out it was completely wrong.  In this case the code it provided wouldn't even compile

[ASSISTANT]
In that situation, how did you try to check or debug the answers it gave you before deciding to move on?

[USER]
I manually updated the code and recompiled then saw it was not correct

[ASSISTANT]
After that attempt, where did you turn next for help—did you look at docs, source code, or check with anyone?

[USER]
Unfortunately there are no docs for this product which is probably why AI was so bad at finding a solution.  I am going to need to fix it myself

[ASSISTANT]
Could you share a recent time when using it did work well on a coding task? What was the task and what made its help useful there?

[USER]
Yes - I was trying to an identity server called Keycloak to an existing application and it was able to guide me through that successfully

[ASSISTANT]
In that Keycloak example, which parts did it handle and which parts did you do yourself?

[USER]
I brought the server in via a Docker container and integrated it into the Aspire host.  The AI was able to configure it the way I needed it to work with little effort on my part

[ASSISTANT]
In that setup, did you find yourself reviewing or tweaking what it produced, or was it mostly plug and play?

[USER]
It was a mix of both, sometimes I had to guide it into more specific needs but the initial setup was mostly just plug and play

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to doing that Keycloak integration without it, how did using it change the time you spent and the way you went about the work?

[USER]
It would have taken me significantly longer to do all that setup myself.  I possibly could have found an open-source implementation on GitHub that closely matched my needs and copied that as a base but AI was able to do that without having to spend the time looking and modifying it myself

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Only as another talking point between team members.  We all use it extensively day-to-day so it is helpful when other people find new ways to use it within our workflows

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific time a teammate shared a new way to use it that changed how you worked on a task? What did you try, and what difference did it make?

[USER]
One of my co-workers took a prompt engineering class and was able to bring back a lot of good ideas on how to get better results from AI via the way you talk to it

[ASSISTANT]
What is one technique you adopted from that class that you now use when you talk to it?

[USER]
Establishing a role for the AI - starting off with "you are a/an..." and forcing it to scope itself within that role seems to help it from straying off-topic too much and increase it's success rate

[ASSISTANT]
Has using it changed how you and your teammates divide up work or collaborate on projects?

[USER]
No we still run everything essentially the same, it is used more for a tool to help complete tasks as opposed to organizational flow

[ASSISTANT]
Has it changed anything in how your manager or stakeholders judge the quality or timing of your work?

[USER]
No, we have stressed that it can be wildly inaccurate and it is really hard to assume it will always increase your productivity... a lot of times it does the opposite if you get into a time sink loop where it never gets you the answer you are looking for

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I do not want to become someone who only writes prompts and waits for AI to do something. I enjoy solving problems, building solutions, etc and if that was removed from my job because AI can do it then I would likely find a different career

[ASSISTANT]
Why is that kind of problem‑solving and building important for you to keep in your day‑to‑day work?

[USER]
It is engaging and fulfilling to me as an engineer.  If I did not get to do that it removes one of the major reasons for doing what I am doing

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI did most of that problem solving and building, how do you think it would change your role on the team?

[USER]
I would become a babysitter for AI

[ASSISTANT]
What would that shift to “babysitting” change about how you relate to your teammates or stakeholders?

[USER]
My teammates would be in the same position.  Someone would need to drive the AI and verify it's results so I don't know if I the relationship with stakeholders would change much

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
It already does a lot of the stuff that I found less desirable for me like writing documentation, automated testing, fixing smaller issues.  I would just like it to work with more accuracy

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, if a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Autonomy at my organization is exactly why I have worked here for 20+ years.  I enjoy having the freedom to try new things as long as it doesn't interfere with the work needed to keep the company working.  It has allowed me to find many solutions and products that have made the company profitable and successful in that time

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from the past year when you had that freedom and what you did with it?

[USER]
I saw a need where developers were consistently running into friction with a reporting solution we had, so I took it upon myself to find an alternative way to handle it, implement a proof of concept to show to the stakeholders, then get the solution up and running making their day-to-day work much more pleasurable and freeing them up to do other things

[ASSISTANT]
In that reporting project, which parts were entirely your call and which parts needed someone else’s sign‑off?

[USER]
I was in charge of everything except for the purchasing of the new software which I presented along with the savings it would bring

[ASSISTANT]
I can imagine two versions of what you described. One is freedom to choose which problems to pursue. The other is freedom to decide how to approach a problem you have been given. Which one fits better for you, or do you mean something else?

[USER]
I have freedom of both.  Usually with my R&D projects I am given a goal to work for but like in the case above I set the goal based on observations within the team

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
I don't have any more comments, it is a nice tool that I think is extremely over-hyped in how much it can actually deliver.  I would not want to go back to not having it as a tool in my toolbag

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers!

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Mostly supervisors. It comes up when we need analysis, predictions, answers and customer support

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks. Could you tell me a bit more about your role and what your typical day looks like? What kinds of tasks are you personally responsible for?

[USER]
I usually generate code. Then we have meetings around noon to discuss new innovations or solutions to customer service issues . I also supervise a group of other coders

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good boss, a good team and flexible work schedule

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a good boss, what does that look like in day-to-day interactions?

[USER]
Someone who is understanding

[ASSISTANT]
What makes a team “good” in your experience?

[USER]
You have already asked me these questions

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for flagging that. Let’s move on.

Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I have answered that as well. The last question you asked me was about AI role in my job

[ASSISTANT]
Got it. Could you walk me through the last time you used AI on a coding task, step by step? What did you do and what did the AI do?

[USER]
I needed code for generating a command. AI assistant gave me the proper coding language so I didn't have an issue

[ASSISTANT]
In that situation, what parts did you write yourself and what parts came from the assistant?

[USER]
I wrote the code as I knew it but the AI revised it and I saw I had missed some important characters

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when you noticed those missing characters?

[USER]
It was something I never would've thought about so I was very thankful to the AI

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to doing that kind of command without the assistant, how did the timing and flow of your work change, if at all?

[USER]
It cut down on time and frustration

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that task?

[USER]
I had time to revise some of my coworkers work

[ASSISTANT]
When you were revising your coworkers’ work, did you bring the assistant into that process, or was that purely your own review?

[USER]
Only if they needed the AI assistance

[ASSISTANT]
Has there been a time when the assistant gave you something wrong or misleading on a coding task? What happened and how did you handle it?

[USER]
I never had a misleading code with AI assistance

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it now, how does it affect your confidence when you’re ready to ship the code?

[USER]
It makes me very confident, however I feel it might be handicapping me

[ASSISTANT]
When you say it might be handicapping you, what exactly do you worry you’re losing or not practicing enough?

[USER]
I feel I might lose some of my coding skills if I keep relying on it's revision

[ASSISTANT]
What, if anything, are you doing to keep your coding skills sharp while you’re using the assistant for revisions?

[USER]
Studying in my free time

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Not really

[ASSISTANT]
Can you think of a recent interaction with a teammate or someone you supervise where this tool came up? What happened in that exchange?

[USER]
An employee was having issues coding and I told him to go to the AI assistant

[ASSISTANT]
How did they respond when you suggested the assistant, and did that change how you worked with them on that task?

[USER]
They did as I and got the results they were going for

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future, is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
My job as a whole. I'm afraid I might be replaced one day

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about your role, what’s the part you feel needs to stay in your hands, and why would it matter if an AI did that instead?

[USER]
Coding because I went to school for it, so if AI took over, it would mean my education was a waste

[ASSISTANT]
If AI did most of the coding, how do you think that would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
I wouldn't be needed as much

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily hand over to an AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Hiring decisions

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up hiring decisions?

[USER]
It's frustrating and time consuming

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled hiring, how do you think that would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
They wouldn't blame me for bad hires

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, if a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Autonomy means being in control of your work and not having a higher up breathing down your neck

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from your job of what being in control of your work looks like in practice?

[USER]
It means making your schedule, coming in getting your job done and having satisfaction

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent day when you made key choices about how to tackle your tasks without checking in first. What did you decide?

[USER]
I came in, delegated tasks to my team and we generated a profile for a new marketing campaign

[ASSISTANT]
On that campaign day, what was one decision you made on your own that had the biggest impact on the work, and what happened as a result?

[USER]
Delegating tasks; I knew which employee to give certain tasks to

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might understand what you just said. Do you mean having the freedom to choose how you do the tasks, or do you mean choosing which tasks and priorities to take on? Which fits better, or is it something else?

[USER]
I know how to give each employee a task based on their strengths so when it's time to compile our information, there is flow

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything we haven’t covered about how AI is affecting your work that you’d like to add?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers!

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an IT support specialist

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I would say that work itself need to hold some meaning or purpose to the person doing it. I think you need to be payed fairly and a decent work life balance is good.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say meaning or purpose, what does that look like for you in day to day terms?

[USER]
I try to see how my work links up to something bigger than the job itself. I also like to be tangible results from my work. For example fixing someone's work pc lets them do their job and I can directly see that.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a decent work life balance, what does that look like in practice for you?

[USER]
You have time and energy to do stuff in your personal life

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It helps me be more productive but I also think it might also lower the quality of said work but I think the extra efficiency it brings probably outweighs the lower quality.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used AI on a specific ticket, step by step? What did you do first, and where did AI come in?

[USER]
The last time I used AI on a ticket was when a user reported slow access to a shared drive, I collected basic diag first. I fed those results into an AI tool to quickly summarize the likely cause and draft the next troubleshooting steps. I then used it to generate a clean user update and a small PowerShell snippet, which I reviewed and adjusted before taking action.

[ASSISTANT]
Did the AI make any mistakes in the summary or the PowerShell, and how did you handle that?

[USER]
Yes it made a few mistakes but I just ran over it myself and touched up the mistakes and it worked fine.

[ASSISTANT]
When you spotted those mistakes, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
Well I know LLM's are not perfect so it was to be expected.

[ASSISTANT]
How did handling this ticket with AI compare to how you used to handle similar issues before?

[USER]
It was probably like 25% faster than without an AI

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that ticket?

[USER]
All I did was get to my other work faster

[ASSISTANT]
When you use AI on a ticket like that, do you find yourself feeling more confident in the outcome or double‑checking more than usual? What leads you there?

[USER]
Well I always check over stuff the AI spits out but after I ran over the info myself I felt confident.

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re reviewing or correcting what the AI produced, does that feel like you’re really using your skill, or more like cleanup work? What stands out to you about that part of the process?

[USER]
I still have to know what i'm doing to interface with the stuff

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time when the AI’s suggestion would have caused a problem if you had followed it as written? What happened and how did you catch it?

[USER]
AI once suggested fixing a slow-login issue by deleting a user's local profile folder, but it missed that the folder contained locally stored project data. Before running the command, I checked the profile size and saw the unsynced files, which would have been lost. I instead backed up the data first and used a safer repair method, which prevented any data loss.

[ASSISTANT]
Aside from troubleshooting tickets, are there other parts of your role where AI has changed how you work?

[USER]
Yeah, LLMs have sped up alot of non troubleshooting stuff in my job. I used it to draft a clearer documentation and internal KB articles, to generate first pass versions of training materials on user guides and to automate repetitive tasks like writing boilerplate scripts or email templates. it's also user for quickly summarizing long policy updates or vendor release notes so I can focus on what actually affects our environment.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
gonna be honest I don't really think it has changed much on my end at leas yet.

[ASSISTANT]
Have your manager’s expectations around speed or volume shifted as you’ve started using these tools?

[USER]
Not that I have noticed but they might just not be telling me

[ASSISTANT]
Have any of your coworkers talked with you about using AI on tickets or docs? What kinds of reactions or norms are you seeing on your team, if any?

[USER]
Yes multiple have talked about it. Pretty much everyone I work with utilizes AI. Even though some might not love it. Its undeniable that it increases productivity.

[ASSISTANT]
Have any users or clients reacted to updates or materials you produced with AI, and what was that interaction like?

[USER]
Nope not that I have seen

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Yes I think any parts that involve trust that only a human can provide is super important.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent situation at work where that kind of trust really mattered? What happened?

[USER]
A few weeks ago an employee was close to breaking down because a spreadsheet they spent days on would not open and they thought it was gone. Instead of jumping straight into technical jargon I sat with them and walked them through what they did and reassured them that we could recover the data if need be. I think that human interaction mattered it kept them from panicking and helped us work together until we restored the data.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is being the person who provides that kind of steadiness important for you to keep?

[USER]
I just dont think an LLM can replace that kind of human touch so to say.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI tried to handle that kind of situation end to end, how do you think it would change how your coworkers see you or your role on the team?

[USER]
I am not sure to be honest but I dont think it would be positive.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Any kind of work that requires mindless data entry.

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up mindless data entry? What makes that the first thing you’d hand off?

[USER]
Its boring and isnt that complicated.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over the data entry, how do you think it would change how others see your contribution on the team, if at all?

[USER]
I dont think anyone would care.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them autonomy means having the know how, skills, and confidence to make decisions about how to solve problems without waiting for step-by-step instructions, while knowing when to escalate or seek input.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from the past month when you made a call without waiting for instructions, and what checks you used to be sure it was the right move?

[USER]
Last month a user reported that Outlook kept crashing when sending large attachments. Instead of immediately escalating, I first checked their mailbox size, add-ins, and recent updates. I decided to temporarily move large attachments to OneDrive and adjust their Outlook cache settings. I verified the fix by having the user test sending a large file and confirming no crashed, then documented the steps in the ticket.

[ASSISTANT]
What tells you it’s time to escalate rather than proceed on your own—what specific signals do you look for?

[USER]
When its either a some what risky situation or if after repeated troubleshooting I cant find an answer.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say making decisions without step-by-step instructions, are you mainly talking about choosing the technical approach on a ticket, or also setting priorities and timelines for your work?

[USER]
Mostly the technical side

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t touched on?

[USER]
Not really tbh

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and your thoughtful answers. 

Thank you very much for your answers!

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work with autistic individuals

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
The core characteristics are treating employees ethically, paying a decent living wage, not requiring unethical behavior in the workplace, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say treating employees ethically, what does that look like day to day in a workplace?

[USER]
That would include being respectful to workers, not requiring unpaid work, not insulting workers, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond ethical treatment and fair pay, what else matters most to you in a good job?

[USER]
Being able to work on things I'm interested in

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use AI to help format session notes and convert my voice to text descriptions of sessions into grammatically correct notes

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used it to produce a session note, step by step? What did you do first, and what did the AI do?

[USER]
First I would write paper notes in the session, then later I would read the session notes out loud on my PC with my PC mic and then use voice to text conversion software to convert the notes into text, and whilst doing that I'm also adding additional details I think of at the moment, then I take that big block of text and give it to the AI to clean up, convert words that might have been misheard into the right words, etc. Then I'll proofread that for any errors, and then I have a text to voice program read the notes back to me to make sure it all flows well.  The AI just helps me to correct grammar, add punctuation, correct misheard words, etc. I do nearly all the work myself and I quadruple check the AI every step of the way because I know it constantly makes mistakes.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example of a mistake it made recently, and tell me how you handled it?

[USER]
For example, sometimes it doesn't create sentences that flow well and I'll go in and manually change the structure, remove periods, add semicolons, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
When you catch those flow issues or misheard words, what goes through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
I think "Oh, it didn't do what I wanted, let me rectify that"

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to before you used these tools, how has your workflow for notes changed, if at all?

[USER]
It's a little faster, because I used to use Grammarly for spell checking and grammar and the AI does it slightly faster

[ASSISTANT]
When you read through the AI-polished note, do you feel more confident in the final write-up or less, and what leads you to that judgment?

[USER]
I feel alright, I mean it's basically just saving me a little time

[ASSISTANT]
What do you usually do with the time you save on notes?

[USER]
I work on other projects because I live in Southern California, the most expensive place in almost all the US to live. I work about 16+ hours a day every day and all I ever do is work because employers refuse to pay a decent pay for highly educated workers in 2025.

[ASSISTANT]
Are there any other parts of your work where you bring these tools in, beyond preparing session notes?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I don't think it has made much difference

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I wouldn't want to handle the actual interactions I have with the autistic people because I don't think AI can read human emotions the way a human can

[ASSISTANT]
Why is that part of the work important for you to keep?

[USER]
It's important to keep a human connection

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent moment when being face to face changed how you worked with someone? What stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
I was recently working with someone in person and I could tell they were upset so I changed my attitude.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over those person-to-person interactions, how do you think it would change your relationships with your clients or your role on the team?

[USER]
I don't know what I would do as a large part of my job is the in person interactions. I would feel as if I had nothing to do.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
There are some tedious work related activities that I would delegate, such as bureaucratic paperwork, tedious filling in forms, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up those paperwork and form-filling tasks?

[USER]
I would give those up because I don't enjoy doing them

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those forms, how do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team, if at all?

[USER]
I don't think it would change anything because I don't think anyone would know.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them that autonomy is a double edged sword and the good thing is the freedom but the bad thing is you have handle everything yourself and it gets overwhelming sometimes

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that freedom looks like in practice in your day to day work?

[USER]
Freedom is being able to arrange my own schedule with work, depending on availability of the autistic people.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent time when handling everything yourself felt like too much?

[USER]
Well, recently I have been working a lot and arranging the sessions, handling phone calls from the parents, making lesson plans, etc., does get to be a lot sometimes, especially because I don't get paid for a lot of it.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say you have to handle everything yourself, what kinds of decisions are you making on your own that weigh on you the most?

[USER]
The hardest decisions are trying to juggle all the things I need to do, such as work related stuff, planning things with my girlfriend, paying for my living expenses (I live alone), and making a budget and sticking to it (my GF likes to go out to eat a lot and I cannot afford it and it leads to problems sometimes).

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
Well, one problem that has arisen is that I used to do freelance tech writing work on the side and all those jobs have been replaced with AI, and it's hard when you live in the US that has no social safety net at all and if you don't have a job you will likely just die of starvation, and all the jobs are being taken by robots.

[ASSISTANT]
I hear that, thank you for being candid. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work, or does this cover the main points?

[USER]
I feel this covers the main points

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Duration: 29.01 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an IT professional

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I think what I most value/look for in a job is good work environment, good salary, and a good work/life balance though the last one is more or less a pipedream

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a good work environment, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
Management trusting those below them, coworkers being cooperative not necessarily nice but able to work together and a safe environment for workers.

[ASSISTANT]
When you mentioned work and life balance being a pipedream, what makes it hard to achieve in your line of work?

[USER]
In my current role I am on call a lot and if I were to try and jobshop a bit I think I would need to be on call more or less everywhere I go, so its just  bit tough at the moment

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a good salary, what makes it feel fair to you?

[USER]
Fair market value basically, or to be more specific alot of the better companies/recruiters will bake in salary/col adjustments into starting salary

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
Management has tried a lot to implement more and more AI programs for tasks they deem "monotonous" or think me and my team shouldn't be bothered doing and I can't seem to convince them how bad of an idea this is  given theyre handling sensitive details and often make mistakes

[ASSISTANT]
Could you walk me through a recent example of one of those tasks—what the AI was set up to do, what you did, and what actually happened?

[USER]
Okay so we have a ticket system for basically everything, issues/equipment requests/general questions etc. Management has tried to implement an AI chatbot so one of me or my team wouldn't have to monitor the tickets and on the initial rollout there were quite a few issues of the AI marking tickets resolved that they hadn't even responded to. Instead of immediately letting management know(because they're too stubborn to fix it initially) I let the AI do a bit more damage before I decided to inform them and when I did they immediately rescinded the AI chatbot.

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when you saw tickets getting closed without any response?

[USER]
My immediate thoughts were something along the lines of I told you so

[ASSISTANT]
After you noticed it happening, what did you do step by step before you told management?

[USER]
I documented everything, the initial problems and the subsequent ones and then spoke to management and showed them everything

[ASSISTANT]
What happened for the people who had their tickets closed—did any of them reach out, and how did you handle those cases?

[USER]
Thankfully the volume wasn't large enough that it was insurmountable but I was putting out the respective fires as they came up and luckily didn't need to bring anyone else in on it

[ASSISTANT]
In that rollout, what did the chatbot actually do compared to what you would normally do when you monitor tickets?

[USER]
As a ticket came in the chatbot would give a default greeting, ask how it could help(which just forces them to restate their problem and likely aggrevate them) and then using keywords/buzzwords would try its best to help them

[ASSISTANT]
How did working tickets during that period compare to how you handled them before the chatbot—what changed in your pace or workflow?

[USER]
I basically only interacted with the tickets when the chatbot hit a wall, and then they were farmed out to me. It interrupted my workflow as I had to learn about the ticket way after the issue had arose

[ASSISTANT]
When those stalled tickets landed on your plate after the chatbot hit a wall, what stands out to you about how you reacted in the moment?

[USER]
Usually just anger or frustration because I could've sold this instantly as I saw the ticket but management decided the bot was a better idea.

[ASSISTANT]
Looking back on that rollout, what, if anything, worked well for you?

[USER]
Truthfully, nothing I can't recall a single thing that was better as all it did was anger me that people couldn't get help in a timely manner and would think its my teams fault but in reality we had no control over it

[ASSISTANT]
Besides the ticket chatbot, has anything else using AI touched your work lately?

[USER]
No, but management has encouraged us to introduce any sort of AI assistance to our daily workflow if we think it would help

[ASSISTANT]
Have you tried bringing any AI tools into your own workflow so far? If so, what did you try and what happened?

[USER]
No I have no real desire to bring any AI tools into my own workflow

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It has made it a bit harder to trust my newer coworkers as theres no way for me to know how competent someone is anymore

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent moment with a newer coworker when you weren’t sure what they could handle on their own? What happened?

[USER]
We had a newer hire come in from a different department and he was just a junior technician so we weren't really worried even if he wasn't super knowledgeable the things we would have to help him with wouldn't be major but we were very wrong as three days into his tenure he got phished and we had to completely reboot all our servers

[ASSISTANT]
When that happened, how did it change the way you and the team interacted with him in the days that followed?

[USER]
Initially we were all a bit frustrated but recognized its not his fault he was thrust here and also wasn't properly taught protocols as he was sort of rushed into the role

[ASSISTANT]
After that, did you change anything about how you coordinate or review each other’s work?

[USER]
For the junior technicians we did a sort of senior buddy system where they'd have to check everything you did and when they trusted you enough we'd give them a bit of a longer leash

[ASSISTANT]
After the chatbot episode, did anything shift in how you talk with management or how much they listen when you raise concerns?

[USER]
No, I think my team has too much contempt for management for any promising discussions. We basically only talk to them when we have to.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Anything to do with sensitive details, I already dont trust companies with them in general given how poor most security is and how little they seem to care about data management

[ASSISTANT]
Can you share a specific type of sensitive task you handle, and what risks you see if an AI took that on?

[USER]
Yeah when onboarding new employees we handle all the information to store on our servers and sanitize it/password protect it once its there and I wouldn't ever trust AI with any form of sensitive information

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping that onboarding and data handling work in your own hands important to you?

[USER]
If any of that data got out it could be used/abused by bad actors to harm those who trusted us with it

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over that onboarding and data handling, how do you think it would change your role on the team or the way teammates rely on you?

[USER]
I think me and my teammates would both think less of management to a point we don't view them as capable

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I cannot think of any, I don't trust AI to do anything of importance and theres no task I do that I don't deem important in some capacity otherwise I wouldnt be doing it

[ASSISTANT]
What, if anything, would need to be true for you to feel okay handing even a small, low‑risk piece of your work to a system like that?

[USER]
I think there would need to be alot of safeguards/redunancies in place for me to feel comfortable deferring any work to an AI system.

[ASSISTANT]
What kinds of safeguards or redundancies would matter most to you before you’d trust a system with even a tiny piece of work?

[USER]
Basically before AI acts in any capacity someone would be babysitting it checking every decision it makes etc

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
At this point autonomy in our field is management or those above you trusting you to do what you were hired to do, maybe not with complete impunity but without constant micromanagement

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your job of what that trust looks like in practice? For instance, a time when you felt you were left to handle something without being hovered over.

[USER]
Yeah we had a big client migrating their business to our company and we had to transfer all their  previous data to our systems and my boss used to insist on doing this himself and then about a year or so ago started deferring the bigger projects to me and my team and would usually still hover around making sure we didn't mess up, but with this client he trusted us to complete this migration all on our own and it felt pretty big for us.

[ASSISTANT]
In that migration, what were the key calls you and your team made without needing sign‑off, and how did those choices shape the outcome?

[USER]
It wasn't about any specific calls it was moreso that he trusted us to get the little things right.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me one of those little things you handled during that migration and what difference it made in the end?

[USER]
Yeah usually when a client comes to us from another company we like to take them out to dinner and the liason is usually my boss but instead this time he sent me and I looked into the clients background and found out he was korean and decided to take him out to korean bbq and it went over really well.

[ASSISTANT]
If a new hire asked you how to earn that kind of trust from a supervisor in their first few months, what would you tell them to do?

[USER]
Do your job, if you're ever confused ask questions. It is far better to ask questions than to go in blind and hope you'll figure out.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
Nope, I think I've said my peace

[ASSISTANT]

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
i work as a it help desk tier 2

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Work life balance

[ASSISTANT]
What does that balance look like in your day-to-day life?

[USER]
having enough time to enjoy things i like off of work

[ASSISTANT]
Are there any other qualities you consider essential in a good job?

[USER]
Good boss,good working office , and the chair is really important

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a good boss, what makes a boss good in your experience?

[USER]
One the is understanding of issues that i might have in or out of work

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use it all the time

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it at work—what were you trying to do?

[USER]
i used it today and i was trying to figure out the correct 568 b config

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, what did you ask the AI, and what did you do next once you got its answer?

[USER]
i asked it whats the correct color order and once i got the answer i fixed it

[ASSISTANT]
Did you double-check the color order the AI gave you, or did you go straight to fixing it?

[USER]
i did not double check it i went straight into fixing it

[ASSISTANT]
Did the fix work on the first try, or did you have to revisit anything after applying the color order it gave you?

[USER]
it worked on the first try

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when you decided not to double-check and just go ahead with the fix?

[USER]
it'll probably be right

[ASSISTANT]
Has it ever given you an answer about a configuration or procedure that turned out to be off?

[USER]
yes and i re promtoed it and correct it

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time it was off—what exactly was wrong, and how did you spot the issue?

[USER]
it told me the port for https was 80 when its 443 it got confused between http and https

[ASSISTANT]
When you noticed the port mismatch, what was your gut response?

[USER]
it got confused

[ASSISTANT]
After you realized it mixed up the ports, what did you do next to get to the right answer?

[USER]
i already knew the right answer i corrected the ai in hopes it would remeber

[ASSISTANT]
Besides things like cable standards and ports, what other tasks at the help desk do you turn to AI for?

[USER]
wifi standards

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
some people at my job dont like ai and due to that we can get it arguments about it but nothing crazy

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent disagreement—what set it off, and how did the conversation unfold?

[USER]
we were talking about the ai bubble and if it will crash i said i dont think it i will they disagree

[ASSISTANT]
How did that disagreement affect how you worked together that day, if at all?

[USER]
he was a little tense but good the next day

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
no not at all

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you comfortable handing over any part of your job—what’s behind that view?

[USER]
less work for me

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled most of your tasks, how do you think that would change your role on the team or how others see your contribution?

[USER]
might get replaced or fired

[ASSISTANT]
When that thought about being replaced crossed your mind, what was your gut response?

[USER]
that sucks but its inevitable

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
taking calls

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up taking calls?

[USER]
dealing with people on the phone can be annoying

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over the calls, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
i would be able to get more physical work done

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled the calls, are there any kinds of situations where you’d still want to step in yourself?

[USER]
if the issue is more complitcated then what the ai understands

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
it means having some of your job done by ai

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example of what that looks like in practice for you, when some of your job is done by AI?

[USER]
like when i forget something on the job i  can ask ai

[ASSISTANT]
When you ask AI for help and get an answer, how do you decide whether to go with it right away or to verify it first?

[USER]
i usually dont verify

[ASSISTANT]
What, if anything, would make you decide to verify an AI’s answer before acting on it?

[USER]
id only verfiy it if i clearly knew it was wrong

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
it helps me a lot

[ASSISTANT]
Is there anything else you want to make sure we cover about AI’s impact on your work?

[USER]
not that i can think of

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a senior quality engineer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
being loyal, working hard, becoming an expert in your craft, being open to learning

[ASSISTANT]
When you say being loyal, what does that look like in a typical week?

[USER]
that means working to the best of your ability, getting your work done on time

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me what becoming an expert in your craft looks like for you day to day?

[USER]
knowing the ins and outs of whatever you do for work. being the person people go to for questions/help

[ASSISTANT]
What does being open to learning look like for you in practice?

[USER]
always seeking new information about your career and finding new learning opportunities whenever you can

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
we use ai a lot, especially for coding

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent coding task where you used it, step by step?

[USER]
yep! I recently had to write an automated test for a new feature we were building. I wrote out the steps, gave copilot access to the code files, then asked it to write the test with those steps in cypress. then I ran the test, fixed the errors, created a pull request

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did it handle, and which parts did you do yourself?

[USER]
it handled creating the outline of the test and writing out the cypress steps, I handled running it/testing it/fixing it

[ASSISTANT]
Did it make any mistakes in that test, and if so, what did you run into?

[USER]
yes, it used some methods that didn't exist, and I had to change some variable names that weren't descriptive enough

[ASSISTANT]
When you spotted those issues, what went through your mind in the moment?

[USER]
I was pretty mad that it basically made up cypress functions that didn't exist, but also I understand that ai isn't perfect

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing that test with it compare to how you would have done it before you had these tools?

[USER]
it did make it a lot easier to get started and I didn't have to look up syntax

[ASSISTANT]
When it helped you get started faster, what did you do with the time you saved on that task?

[USER]
I wrote more tests

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re reviewing and correcting what it produced, how does that work land with you — does it feel like you’re putting your expertise to good use, or more like cleanup?

[USER]
it feels like a mixture of both

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it on a high‑stakes change, does it leave you feeling more confident in the result or less, and what drives that reaction?

[USER]
I think it makes me a little more nervous, since it might not have the context it needs to not break other things

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
my relationships with coworkers/

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me more about how it has affected your interactions with your coworkers?

[USER]
it has not affected my interactions at all with coworkers.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I still want to do manual UI checks when I test features, I don't trust AI to be able to see the UI and notice changes/ things different/broken

[ASSISTANT]
What makes doing those checks yourself important to you?

[USER]
being able to visually confirm that nothing is broken

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over those visual checks, how do you think it would change your role on the team?

[USER]
I would still probably be double checking, as well as doing the rest of my job

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time your own eyes caught something the tools missed? What stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
there was minor ui changes (spacing was off on a table) that I caught that were not caught in testing, and I was glad I took the time to check. I am very detail oriented, so im good at spotting things even if they are really minor

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would let it write peer-reviews around annual review time and my self review.

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to hand off those reviews?

[USER]
I don't like writing, they are very time consuming

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those reviews, do you think it would change how your manager or teammates see your contribution in any way?

[USER]
probably not

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI drafted those reviews for you, how would you want to check or shape them before submitting?

[USER]
I would probably to a check, as well as remove words that maybe I wouldn't normally use

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would highly suggest they find ways to use ai to better themself/learn. Don't completely rely on AI to the point where you no longer know how to do the task on your own. Pair with AI, use your knowledge and its expertise to create something together.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what pairing with it looks like in practice on a real task?

[USER]
I would ask it to create a boiler plate code file, then I could fill in the functions/methods with the code. then you dont have to do the monotonous part

[ASSISTANT]
What signals tell you it’s time to stop asking the tool for help and take over fully yourself?

[USER]
when its running into errors, repeating itself, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you share a specific decision on a test or code change where you overruled what it suggested, and what led you to make that call?

[USER]
I recently asked it to fix my test, but it ended up re-arranging it all and adding comments EVERYWHERE. I removed the comments, they were unnecessary and just added more lines that didn't need to be there.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
I think ai is doing great, but we need to make sure it still has human supervision!

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing your experiences and insights. Is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
that's all!

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work as a software developer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I think having meaningful work and getting a sense of accomplishment is very important. Working in an environment where you feel appreciated and respected.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say meaningful, what makes it meaningful to you in practice?

[USER]
I think solving problems for people and helping people.

[ASSISTANT]
What tells you that you’re appreciated and respected at work?

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm a programmer/analyst

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks. Could you tell me a bit about what your work looks like day to day, for example the kinds of projects you take on or what a typical day involves?

[USER]
My daily tasks vary; I work with student data for a large school district, so I deal with all kinds of data-related issues. I do a bit of work with SQL and Crystal, for creating custom reports.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Pleasant work environment--low stress, conducive to productivity, amiable co-workers and supervisors, etc. Tasks that though challenging are rewarding and promote a sense of purpose.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about a low‑stress environment in practice, what does that look like day to day in your workplace?

[USER]
I work in a suite with 10 others, but we all have our own space, we all get along, and and collaborate when necessary. It's quiet, comfortable, and allows me to work in peace.

[ASSISTANT]
When a task feels challenging in a good way for you, what about it makes it feel worthwhile or gives you that sense of purpose?

[USER]
I like to know that when I've successfully completed a challenging task that the outcome is useful and/or helpful to someone or a number of people. Since I work with student data, it's a good feeling to know that I am ultimately helping administrators make decisions for the benefit of students.

[ASSISTANT]
Of everything you’ve mentioned so far, what feels absolutely non‑negotiable for you in a good job?

[USER]
Reasonable work load in a low-pressure environment.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
As of right now, it's fairly minimal. We have no official AI implementation in our company and I don't know of plans to go that route.

[ASSISTANT]
Got it. Have you personally tried using any AI tools, even informally, on any of your tasks like SQL, Crystal reports, or data cleanup? If so, can you tell me about the last time?

[USER]
Yes, I use AI a few times a week to ask general information or to help me work through a coding question. It depends on the nature of the inquiry though because I work with seasoned programmers whose knowledge is vast.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent time you used it for a coding question, step by step from what you asked to what you ended up doing?

[USER]
I can't recall a specific example at the moment; I'd have to look through my history to see if something is there worth mentioning.

[ASSISTANT]
No problem. When you ask a coding question in general, what do you usually put into the prompt, and what do you do with the response once you get it?

[USER]
I only general questions about how to formulate a query since the specifics depend on the information in our databases. Unrelated to SQL, I have had AI assist with a powershell script that to assist me with filtering out certain platforms when I run system updates.

[ASSISTANT]
In that PowerShell script example for filtering platforms during updates, which parts did the tool generate, and what did you end up changing or adding yourself?

[USER]
AI generated the majority of the script since my powershell knowledge is pretty basic.

[ASSISTANT]
When you got that script back, how did you test it and what, if anything, did you tweak before putting it into use?

[USER]
I ran the first iteration and it returned a couple of errors, so I fed those errors to the bot and it modified the script. A couple of more rounds of small tweaks and it got to where it was doing what I wanted, so I was pleased with it.

[ASSISTANT]
As you were going back and forth fixing those errors, what went through your mind about the tool’s suggestions and your own role in steering it?

[USER]
I was pretty impressed with its ability to problem solve in this particular case. I've given it other coding prompts related to web coding, and that was a mess. While it did ok with basics, for some reason more complex instructions proved to be a revolving door of fixes and errors.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about one time the web coding help went off the rails and what you did to resolve it or decide to stop?

[USER]
I was building a simple web page/site just for fun (not to be publically visible) partly to test the bot's ability to code. I can do simple HTML and CSS, but wanted to see how efficitient it could be. Basics were fine, but more complex CSS really proved to be troublesome. After a few hours of going in circles, I abandoned the project because it was more work--even with AI--than I wanted to invest in a small side project.

[ASSISTANT]
How did getting that PowerShell task done with the tool compare to how you would have handled it before you had access to it?

[USER]
It drastically reduced the amount of time I would have needed to write it all myself. I could have figured it out eventually, but this was a matter of minutes; it would have probably taken me a few hours to get it the way it ultimately came out.

[ASSISTANT]
When you hit a snag, how do you decide whether to ask an AI tool, look through documentation, or turn to one of the seasoned programmers on your team?

[USER]
It depends on what I'm trying to do. For simple queries, I just look through some tutorials or documentation to figure it out; sometimes I'll ask a bot. If it's more complex and I need to know specifics about data the bot doesn't have access to, I'll ask a coworker.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Interpersonally you mean?

[ASSISTANT]
Yes, with colleagues, managers, or clients. Since you started using these tools, have your interactions with any of them changed in any noticeable way?

[USER]
Not at all

[ASSISTANT]
Do you and your coworkers ever talk about these tools at all, even casually, or is it mostly something you use on your own?

[USER]
It's on my own; I don't recall AI ever coming up in our coding discussions. These guys are seasonsed programming professionals and I would venture to say they have ZERO interest/need in using AI for anything coding related, at least in SQL.

[ASSISTANT]
Have you noticed any shift in what your manager expects from you in terms of speed or output since you started using these tools, or has that stayed the same?

[USER]
No, because using AI has never been discussed with us. For SQL, since AI doesn't have access to our databases, there is probably little concern for management about us using it. Since I am by far the most junior programmer here, I'm surely the only one using it for actual work-related tasks, so it's probably not an issue. I NEVER input even as much as a table name from our database when I ask AI about coding, so I think I'm ok.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
The only thing I would be willing to allow AI to do would be to scan my daily data reports and report to me what issues need to be fixed in the system. I would be hesitant though because those reports contain student PII.

[ASSISTANT]
What is one part of your job you would want to keep doing yourself, even if a tool could do it perfectly?

[USER]
The actual management of student data in our SIS. It's 90% interacting with a GUI, so I don't know how AI would tackle that, but that's the majority of my job, so I wouldn't want to put myself out of work.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes doing that hands‑on data work something you want to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
One upside to AI is efficiency; however, I would feel more comfortable, at least initially, if I could see myself the data I'm altering, inputting, etc. I feel more confident if I know I did the task myself.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Scanning data reports

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up scanning data reports?

[USER]
It's tedious and pretty boring--it's poring over thousands of rows on a spreadsheet looking for anomolies.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI were to scan those reports for you, what safeguards or conditions would you need in place to feel comfortable given the student PII?

[USER]
Preferably that the scanned data is not networked in any way. That's probably unrealistic, but ideally the bot would be hosted locally on-site and all traffic would be internal--no internet-facing connections.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
That my work is my work and not that of someone else or a bot. I think AI is promising in a lot of ways, but I don't want AI to displace people for positions where the personal component of work is removed. Some tasks are perfectly suited for AI, but though I manage data, I also communicate that data to other people and I want them to know I did the work and did it well. Autonomy would, in part, be a lack of dependence on AI to accomplish quality work.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from the past few months when you made a decision or built something where you could say, this was my work and not the tool’s? What did that look like in practice?

[USER]
I built a query recently that was the basis of a custom report for a district administrator. It was more complext than what I normally do so I had to get a coworker to guide me through a part of it, but at the end, I was happy with it and proud of it actually. It was clean, efficient, and made for a good report. I worked out the details, with guidance from my co-worker, and it was exactly what was requested, so that was very satisfying.

[ASSISTANT]
In that report query, what were the parts you decided and owned yourself, and what did your coworker specifically help you with?

[USER]
He helpe me with a subquery that was necessary to pull a specific bit of data that would have taken much more work to do differently. I was a little stuck, so he showed me how to accomplish what I needed in a simpler way.

[ASSISTANT]
If that young person asked how to balance using these tools sometimes and still have the work be recognizably theirs, what concrete habits or guardrails would you suggest?

[USER]
I would probably say that use tools to help you when necessary--that's what tools are for. AI is a tool, but it can be more than that if let it, and I mean in a negative way. Yes, bots can code, but you the programmer have to know the language well enough to see what the bots might be doing incorrectly or inefficiently. They're assitants.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t touched on?

[USER]
I think I've covered the gist of it.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers!

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm a business analyst

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Objective fact finding, research, analysis and recommendations

[ASSISTANT]
When you say objective fact finding, what does it look like when it’s done well in your view?

[USER]
Problem statements with solutions and evidence supporting them

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about the research part, what are the signs it’s been done well?

[USER]
Cross checked against desired outcomes and supported by evidence

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about the analysis and the recommendations, what makes them strong in your book?

[USER]
Reasoned and with actionable outcomes

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
At the moment I use AI as a tool to help me deliver - fact finding, checking, data analysis, reviewing text and generating simple emails

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it for fact finding—what did it do, and what did you handle yourself?

[USER]
Firstly, I never solely rely on AI, I always check any outputs. I used it to analyse customer feedback for our org and breakdown in categories

[ASSISTANT]
In that customer feedback project, which parts did the AI handle and which parts did you do yourself, step by step?

[USER]
AI did the initial collation and categorisations. I did some sanity checks on volumes and sources used to ensure they were complete. I ALSO SPOT CHECKED SOME CASEs

[ASSISTANT]
When you did those spot checks, what stood out to you about the AI’s categorisations or the way it grouped the feedback?

[USER]
It was broadly consistent and in agreement with my observations - a few edge cases I overruled on

[ASSISTANT]
When you overruled those edge cases, what went through your mind as you made that call?

[USER]
Why the AI made that choice and how I could feedback my opinion to improve learning

[ASSISTANT]
How did you actually feed back your judgment in that moment—what steps did you take to correct or adjust the system?

[USER]
I produced a list of corrections and asked the AI to note and apply

[ASSISTANT]
After you applied those corrections, how did doing that project with AI compare to how you would have handled the same feedback analysis without it?

[USER]
It saved me time

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that project?

[USER]
Other tasks I was working on

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re reviewing what the AI produced, what is that experience like for you?

[USER]
Good, I am pleased when it is consistent with my views

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent time you used it to draft a simple email—what did it write, and what did you end up changing before you sent it?

[USER]
Well, I send a lot of emails asking for responses to work that I produce - when I receive the feedback I as AI to draft a simple thank you with next steps - fairly simple requiring minimal amendment

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Not at all

[ASSISTANT]
When you say not at all, can you think of a recent interaction where using or not using AI made no difference in how you and a colleague worked together?

[USER]
In general my role is fairly self contained and how I execute is upto me, and has limited impact on immediate colleagues, other than helping me meet key milestones. They would not even know if I had used AI or not, as I retain quality control

[ASSISTANT]
Do you ever tell managers or clients that you used AI on a piece of work, or do you prefer not to bring it up?

[USER]
If it comes up I will mention it, but no more so than say using Excel - it's just another tool I have available and I am still accountable for all outputs

[ASSISTANT]
Has using AI changed anything about the pace your manager or clients expect from you, like timelines or volume of work?

[USER]
No, it helps me be a bit more productive, but under 10%. There's always plenty of things for me to do

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Customer interaction, managing colleagues and contractors does really benefit from a personal  touch - an AI can't take them out for a meal!

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those conversations with customers or your team better when they come from you personally?

[USER]
Simply the little personal things, asking about family interests etc.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled those customer or team conversations instead of you, how do you think it would change your relationships or your role on the team?

[USER]
I think my customers would feel offended and slighted

[ASSISTANT]
What difference do you notice in the outcomes when those conversations come from you rather than being handled by a system?

[USER]
Not applicable, I don't let AI handle those

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Time recording and admin

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up time recording and admin to AI?

[USER]
tedious and boring

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled your time recording and admin, would it change how others see your contribution to the team in any way?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
The ability to control how I do my jobs (within limits) as long as I successsfully manage my deadlines

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a recent example of what that looked like in practice—when you decided how to do a piece of work and made your own call on the approach?

[USER]
I selected stakeholders to work with, got their buy-in form the start and drip fed so they were involved in the QA process - this made final sign-off easier and less contentious

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, what were the key decisions you made yourself, and what were the limits you had to work within?

[USER]
I had to work within work place behaviours and values, and I had time and budgetary constraints. i CHOSE METHOD OF CONSULTATION AND SCOPE

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re using AI on a piece of work, how does it fit with your ability to decide how you do the job?

[USER]
fINE, i CONTROL WHEN AND WHEN i USE THE ai TOOL

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
Generally positive, a useful subordinate tool that doesn't control me

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. Do you feel we’ve covered everything important about how AI is affecting your work, or is there anything else you want to add?

[USER]
It is upto me whether I use AI or not

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

Duration: 74.21 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Mostly  I handle network setups, system maintenance, troubleshooting, and keeping folks’ tech running smooth. Also scripting, automation, and fixing whatever breaks under the hood.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Steady pay, you can plan your life.

[ASSISTANT]
Besides steady pay, what else matters most to you in a good job?

[USER]
Respect, growth, work-lif balance and purpose

[USER]
A good job, in my opinion, is one that pays well and is stable so you can make stress-free life plans.  Additionally, it requires clear expectations and effective management nothing destroys motivation more quickly than misunderstandings or an uncommunicative boss.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time when clear expectations and good communication made the job feel right to you?

[USER]
I recall a network upgrade project where the manager outlined exactly what had to be done and who was in charge of each task.  There were no surprises; he kept us informed at every stage.  The work went smoothly and it felt like the kind of job where everything clicked because expectations were clear.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI has greatly improved the speed and efficiency of my work.  It takes care of the tedious tasks, such as log checks, simple troubleshooting procedures, and script writing, so I can concentrate on the more difficult issues.  Additionally, it assists me in identifying problems before they become serious, such as reporting strange network patterns.  Although it doesn't take the place of the job, it does make my day easier and free up my time for tasks that genuinely require human intelligence.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the last time you used it to write a script. What did it do, and what did you do?

[USER]
A few weeks ago was the last time I used AI for a script.  To extract system logs from a group of machines and arrange them according to error level, I needed a short PowerShell script.  The AI produced a clean base script in a matter of seconds after I told it what I needed.  Adding a few filters, changing the output format, and ensuring that it worked well with our network configuration were all part of my tweaking.  I tightened the skeleton provided by the AI to make it function as we required.

[ASSISTANT]
In that PowerShell example, did it make any mistakes or miss anything important, and if so, how did you catch and handle that?

[USER]
Yes, it wasn't flawless.  It didn't format the output precisely as I wanted and overlooked a few edge cases, such as handling offline machines.  I discovered it by first executing the script in a test environment.  I then modified the output formatting and added error handling for offline machines.  AI provided me with a strong foundation, but I still needed to prepare it for production.

[ASSISTANT]
When you caught those issues in testing, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
To be honest, I thought, "Yep, figures," at first.  AI comes close, but you still need to monitor it.  I simply went into problem-solving mode instead of being irritated.  I made sure it wouldn't choke in the actual environment, checked where it broke, and filled in the gaps.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved from that scripting task?

[USER]
I used the extra time to troubleshoot a tricky network issue that needed hands-on attention.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent time it flagged strange network patterns and what you did next?

[USER]
Sure. A few weeks ago, our monitoring AI flagged unusual traffic spikes on a few servers late at night. I checked the logs, traced the source, and found a misconfigured backup process flooding the network.

[ASSISTANT]
What was your gut response when that alert came in?

[USER]
My gut reaction was basically, “Alright, something’s off let’s check it out.” Not panic, just that quick instinct to dig in and see what’s going on.

[ASSISTANT]
How does doing that kind of monitoring and scripting now compare to how you handled it before you had these AI tools?

[USER]
It was much more laborious prior to AI, involving painstaking log digging, developing each script from start, and identifying problems only after they were loud.  I now spend more time fixing actual problems rather than looking for them because the tools identify problems early and expedite the tedious labor.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
In fact, it has been beneficial.  The team has more time to collaborate on more complex issues as AI relieves some of our workload.  The interactions are better because people ask each other for assistance more on the actual technical problems rather than the more fundamental ones.

[ASSISTANT]
Have your manager’s expectations about speed or availability changed since you started using these tools?

[USER]
Yes, somewhat.  They anticipate activities being completed more quickly since AI takes care of everyday duties.  However, they also demand improved monitoring and increased precision, so the speed comes with the need to make sure everything is still functioning properly.

[ASSISTANT]
Has it changed how people on your team get credit for work or how expertise is recognized? Can you share an example?

[USER]
A tiny bit.  People are more noticeable when they solve complex problems or optimize systems since AI takes care of the basics.  One teammate, for instance, used AI to create a maintenance script, but the credit went to him for refining it and integrating it seamlessly into our network—his skill was evident, not just the AI's output.

[ASSISTANT]
How have clients or stakeholders reacted to you using AI on projects, if at all?

[USER]
Mostly positive, actually. They like that tasks get done faster and issues get flagged before they become big problems. Some are curious about how it works, but as long as the results are solid, they don’t mind.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Mostly positive, actually. They like that tasks get done faster and issues get flagged before they become big problems. Some are curious about how it works, but as long as the results are solid, they don’t mind.

[ASSISTANT]
I might have been unclear. Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Mostly positive, actually. They like that tasks get done faster and issues get flagged before they become big problems. Some are curious about how it works, but as long as the results are solid, they don’t mind.

[ASSISTANT]
Looking ahead, is there any part of your work you would want to keep in your own hands, even if a tool could do it flawlessly?

[USER]
Of course.  I would keep anything that calls for strategy, judgment, or a grasp of the wider picture.  Scripts and warnings can be handled by tools, but human intelligence is still required for prioritization, update planning, and handling unforeseen issues.

[USER]
Of course.  I would keep anything that calls for strategy, judgment, or a grasp of the wider picture.  Scripts and warnings can be handled by tools, but human intelligence is still required for prioritization, update planning, and handling unforeseen issues.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is it important for you to keep those strategy and big‑picture calls in your own hands?

[USER]
because the entire network and team are impacted by those choices.  Unlike humans, a tool cannot assess risks, comprehend context, or forecast long-term effects.  Errors could spread before anyone notices if I let AI make those decisions.

[ASSISTANT]
If a tool took over those strategy and big picture decisions, how do you think it would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
My role would seem much lesser as a result.  I would switch from directing the job to just responding to the tool's decisions.  The trust and experience we've developed would be weakened if the team relied less on one another's judgment.

[USER]
My role would seem much lesser as a result.  I would switch from directing the job to just responding to the tool's decisions.  The trust and experience we've developed would be weakened if the team relied less on one another's judgment.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily hand over to a tool tomorrow?

[USER]
Don't hesitate to do repetitive troubleshooting and log digging.  That is not particularly exciting and takes a lot of time.  I'm happy to let a tool handle it if it can.

[ASSISTANT]
If a tool handled the repetitive troubleshooting and log digging, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
Not at all.  People would still notice the work I do on tough problems and preparation.  Simply put, automating the tedious tasks allows me to concentrate on the aspects that truly demonstrate my worth.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would explain to them that autonomy entails being trusted to own the results while having the ability to make decisions that truly matter, such as organizing your work, coming up with your own solutions to difficulties, and deciding how to approach challenges.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your job where you were trusted to own the result and make those calls about how to approach it?

[USER]
Yes.  I was tasked with upgrading our core switches last year.  My manager gave me the objective and the due date, but I was left in charge of the entire strategy, including the hardware selection, rollout planning, and downtime reduction.

[ASSISTANT]
In that switch upgrade, tell me about a key decision point you faced and how you decided, including whether any AI tools played a role.

[USER]
One key decision was whether to upgrade all switches at once or in phases. I ran simulations using AI to predict network load and risk for both options.

[ASSISTANT]
After looking at those predictions, what ultimately tipped your decision one way or the other?

[ASSISTANT]
You have cancelled the interview.

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a web developer and also currently lead a team of 6.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
One that allows a person to use their skills, get paid a decent wage, and encourages well being

[ASSISTANT]
When you say it encourages well being, what does that look like for you day to day?

[USER]
That whole work life balance thing, mostly.

[ASSISTANT]
When a job lets you use your skills, what kinds of tasks or decisions show you that most clearly?

[USER]
It depends on the person, but for me I like doing maintenance work and dirty work.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes maintenance and the dirty work satisfying for you?

[USER]
It allows me to stay under the radar. It allows me to help others and free to their time.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
Well first it was a partial cause of a reduction in force and restructuring at my company. But it also allows me to learn skills more quickly.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent time you used AI to learn something for a work task? What was the task, and how did you use it step by step?

[USER]
It can help me learn new languages for a new site or building under new platform. It can help me troubleshoot things that are going wrong with just about anything like databases or a bug and code. It can help me learn abbreviations and acronyms and buzzwords. Just gets me up to date more quickly and what's going on around me and it helps because everything is changing so fast.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last bug you fixed with its help—what was breaking, and what did you do first?

[USER]
Well a lot of the code that I maintain is pretty legacy and so AI is a little bit confused by it cuz it doesn't have a lot of context but I can also go into the code and ask what a certain thing is or does and it will help me nudge it forward just in terms of what it thinks is going wrong. But where it's really helpful is where AI is integrated it to other tools like DynaTrace where if there is a production bug we can go in and look at the particular issue and then ask AI what it thinks is going wrong

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about one specific production incident where you used DynaTrace with AI—what did it surface for you, and what did you do next?

[USER]
Well actually I was just introduced to Donna Trace with AI yesterday because we had dynaclete dynatrase on site and training us all up. So it was just kind of things that they were showing us as they were looking at our site. It was some random error like you know that had to do with a null object not being handled for properly and basically they are able to get to all the way down to the correct method dude determine what was going on we didn't take it farther than that but we got to the method name

[ASSISTANT]
Once it pointed you to the method name, what would your next steps typically be, and which parts would you expect the tool to handle versus what you’d do yourself?

[USER]
Well at that point I for another developer would take it from there and just either using their eyeballs or with more troubleshooting steps figure out what the fix would be maybe write some more unit tests around it or do some testing on their local machine until the bug was fixed and then we would move it on up to QA and have QA look at it and then up to production

[ASSISTANT]
When the reduction and restructuring were linked to AI, what went through your mind at the time?

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a data analyst

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job consists of having a good boss, good team and constructive feedback

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a good boss, what does that look like in practice for you?

[USER]
A boss who is available, considerate and willing to help you succeed

[ASSISTANT]
When you think of a good team, what makes it feel that way day to day?

[USER]
A team is reliable and cooperative

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about constructive feedback, what makes it constructive for you?

[USER]
Telling you what you are doing right what you are doing wrong and if you are doing wrong, they must be able to help you solve the problem

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI has changed the way we hire, the way we analyze and the way we compute data

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used AI on a specific task at work? What were you trying to do, step by step?

[USER]
I used AI while revising a report I had to  get to my boss. Basically it helped me with grammatical errors and helped me generate information to write

[ASSISTANT]
In that report revision, what parts did you handle yourself, and what parts did the AI handle?

[USER]
I wrote the report myself, but AI checked it for grammar and punctuation. Also if I were unsure about certain topics, the AI assistant would generate a quick synopsis

[ASSISTANT]
When the AI generated a synopsis on a topic you were unsure about, how did you check whether it was accurate enough to use?

[USER]
I asked several AI assistants to make sure I had consistency across the board

[ASSISTANT]
When you compared the synopses from different assistants, did they ever conflict with each other, and if so, how did you decide what to trust?

[USER]
They were pretty much in alignment so I didn't question

[ASSISTANT]
In that report scenario, what went through your mind as you were using the AI to polish and fill gaps?

[USER]
I wanted to make sure I had the most thorough and up to date information also make sure it was professional enough

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to how you did this kind of report before, how did using AI change your workflow and the time it took?

[USER]
AI made it much shorter. It generates information so quickly and I don't have to do so much research anymore. Also it helps with grammar

[ASSISTANT]
Outside of writing reports, can you tell me about a time you used AI directly in your data work, like during analysis or modeling? What did you ask it to do, and what did you do yourself?

[USER]
I asked AI to give me an analysis of recent data. It was able to compute different graphs, give me a complete timeline and future forecast

[ASSISTANT]
For that analysis, what data did you give the AI and through what tool, and what outputs did it return back to you?

[USER]
We wanted to estimate if our customers were most like to buy a certain product. We used Gemini and were able to get a line graph and bar graph of future plans

[ASSISTANT]
Before sharing those graphs and the forecast, how did you check whether they were sound enough to rely on?

[USER]
We had used this tech once before and deemed it worthy enough to be trusted

[ASSISTANT]
When you looked over the AI’s analysis and graphs, was there anything you had to adjust or double check before sharing?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
AI is often bought up in conversations. We are trained to work with it

[ASSISTANT]
Who tends to bring it up in conversations at work, and in what situations does it usually come up?

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a QA Tester

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
i'd say a good job provides a comfortable life for the worker and their family as well as alowing freedom from the job to enjoy said life. Work/life balance and fair compensation are important in what I would consider a good job.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a comfortable life, what does that look like for you day to day?

[USER]
I'd say all basic needs are met,t and there is no stress over food or gas or things like that. Plus some spare capital to have fun with here and there, go out to eat, go on vacation etc.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about freedom from the job to enjoy life, what would your ideal schedule or boundaries look like?

[USER]
Ideally, I'd like to see us get to a point where 3 days full-time, or 24 hours, is the new 40 hours and anything over would be considered overtime.  So 3 days on, 4 days off a week.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say fair compensation, how do you judge what’s fair in your field?

[USER]
I'd say fair would be in line with the average or above in my area, compared to others who do the same or similar job.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I work with AI some to provide scripts that I need for testing. I also work to help train AI models

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used it to generate a test script, step by step?

[USER]
I can't give specifis per NDA but I needed some a python script to automate UI testing using Selenium

[ASSISTANT]
In that Selenium example, which parts did the AI draft and which parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
I established the test cases and used AI to draft a few scripts for parts that would be better served being autmated

[ASSISTANT]
What kinds of changes did you make to the AI‑drafted Selenium scripts before you felt comfortable running them?

[USER]
Now that I think about it, I did need to adjust the page locators for the scripts to run properly. But otherwise it was good

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized the locators needed adjustment, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
INot much becasue I kind of expected that to heppen becaause the site changes often. It was no big deal

[ASSISTANT]
About how much time did using it save you on that Selenium task, compared to writing the script yourself?

[USER]
I'd say probably 30+%

[ASSISTANT]
After using those AI‑drafted scripts, how did you gauge whether you could trust them before running them in your full test run?

[USER]
I did a few small tests runs first

[ASSISTANT]
During those small test runs, what were you watching for, and what stood out to you that told you it was safe to roll into the full run?

[USER]
It was just a matter if the test completed or not. If the python code produced runs fine, then theres not much else I need since these are typically small segmented test scripts

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned helping to train models. What does your part in that process look like, step by step?

[USER]
it typically involves sxs comparison of two models' results to a user query, in which I have to determine based on several factors and guidlines, which of the two model respones is better, then include proper data annotation and reasoning

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re deciding which of the two model responses is better, what are the main things you look for?

[USER]
comprehensiveness, factuality, backstory guidelines are probably the main ones

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re doing that side‑by‑side judging, what is the experience like for you in the moment—what’s the mental effort or pace feel like as you work through a batch?

[USER]
depends on the subject matter. Some model responses can require extensive research for verification, and if it is a subject matter I don't care for, it just makes it more taxing for me. The pace overall is steady, but sometimes the brain power used can be a lot, and it can be pretty draining.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about your QA work overall, has using AI changed the way you plan or sequence your testing work in a typical week?

[USER]
I'd say not really at this time

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I don't think it really has. There are people I've worked with before AI was everywhere and our relationships are still the same

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
For QA, not really. Eventually, most of the process will be automated and run by AI; it just makes sense economically and for efficiency purposes. For AI model training, I would absolutely never want to hand that job over to AI, as that would just mean AI was training itself, which is not a feedback loop that would prove beneficial in my (and most people's) opinion.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes human oversight in model training essential, in your view?

[USER]
Models can have hallucinations and issues with factuality, which if left unchecked, could potentially cause issues with models that are trained from said model and vice versa.  Plus humans are the ones using AI so they should never be taken out of the picture completely.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over most of the judging and feedback in model training, how do you think that would change your role on the team or your relationships with others?

[USER]
I wouldn't have any work for that particular team anymore, and so my contract would be cancelled, and I wouldn't have much working relationship with them anymore.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I can't really think of anything that I would give over fully to AI but more augmentation with bug/issue report generation to speed up the process if possible

[ASSISTANT]
What makes bug or issue report generation a good fit for AI to help with in your workflow?

[USER]
Sometimes bug reports can feel repetitive if there are a lot of them and it would be nice if those could be produced with less action from the tester

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I'd say autonomy is when you are given the freedom to do your job how you see fit. You're still going to have a boss and people you have to answer to, but when it comes down to doing your work, you are the one who decides how to go about it.  A quick example in my mind for a young person would be to think of a fast-food worker. If you were a fast food worker and a customer asked for a refund, would you be able to provide the refund? Or would you have to get a manager/higher up to do it? If you can provide the refund without the manager, you have autonomy at that job. If you are required to get a manager, you do not have autonomy.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your QA work where you had that kind of discretion to decide how to do the job?

[USER]
We often do exploratory testing, and while there are best practices, it's essentially up to the testers how to proceed with the testing itself.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent exploratory session when you chose your own path through the product. What choices did you make in the moment, and what told you those were the right moves?

[USER]
I try to follow paths that a typical customer/user would take, as well as paths I would take if I were a customer/user myself.  I don't know for sure if they're the right moves or not, it's kind of just a gut feeling, and I try not to overthink it because you never know what a customer/user might do so there's really no bad exploratory testing .

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through one specific time when your own path in exploratory testing led you to uncover a real issue—what you clicked first, what you tried next, and how you captured and reported it?

[USER]
I was testing a sports streaming app. I'd followed a happy path from Home to a particular streaming video. After that was successful, I just delved deeper into the affiliated paths from said streaming video and found an issue with an associated "similar" video recommendation, which was then captured via screen recording, and a bug report was filed with video and annotation regarding the issue.

[ASSISTANT]
In practice, what kinds of constraints shape how much freedom you have on a given project?

[USER]
Namely time.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
Not that I can think of at the moment. Do you think AI will take all of our jobs in a few years like some people are saying?

[ASSISTANT]
I hear the concern, and there are lots of views on that, but for today I’ll stick to your experience. Thank you again for sharing it.

Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Software engineer

[ASSISTANT]
What kind of software do you build?

[USER]
backend  for financial applications

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
good work-life balance

[ASSISTANT]
When you say work-life balance, what does that look like in your day-to-day?

[USER]
Without overtime and weekend work. And less stressful work environment

[ASSISTANT]
Besides balance, what else matters most to you in a job?

[USER]
Nice people, I mean colleagues. A job contributes to my skills and improvement. Of course it should pay decent

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a job contributes to your skills and improvement, what kinds of growth are you looking for?

[USER]
Professional growth. Makes me a better engineer with challenges, follows new approaches and technologies.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI made things faster and efficient. For simple work is so fast now, and also for challenging parts it always helps, so in general it has a good impact

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific recent task where you used AI, and walk me through what you did with it?

[USER]
There was a concurrency bug in our code in one of our microservices. AI helped me to find and resolve the bug. Normally this kind of bugs can be tricky and hard to find

[ASSISTANT]
In that concurrency bug example, which parts did you rely on the AI for, and which parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
Mostly the whole things was done by AI

[ASSISTANT]
What did the AI actually produce for you in that case — was it an explanation, a code change, tests, or something else — and how did you plug that into your service?

[USER]
A code change which fixes the bug, its tests and explanation about the flow

[ASSISTANT]
How did you verify the fix before deploying it?

[USER]
My local tests and unit tests, and our test suite. Also, our qa team confirmed the result

[ASSISTANT]
When you saw the AI’s proposed fix and explanation, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
I felt like this made sense. And tried by myself, saw the result

[ASSISTANT]
Did the AI make any mistakes or miss anything along the way, and if so, how did you handle that?

[USER]
no not at all. Actually, I asked follow-up questions, ai replied correctly

[ASSISTANT]
How did tackling a bug like that with AI compare to how you would have handled it before?

[USER]
It is far easier and faster. And covering with tests way easier

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved from that bug fix?

[USER]
Picked the next task up

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond debugging, are there other parts of your work where you use it regularly?

[USER]
Yes, when I need to make an architectural  decision I use AI to see different approaches

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last architectural decision where you brought it in, and what you asked it for versus what you decided yourself?

[USER]
We need to start a new service from scratch, we need to apply a pipeline architecture. AI proposed the architecture, with some tweaks we used its recommendations

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I am not sure if it is affects that much but because of works getting done faster now we don't need to discuss a lot of stuff with colleagues

[ASSISTANT]
When you say there’s less to discuss now, how has that changed your day-to-day interactions with your teammates?

[USER]
it is less stresful as we are faster and deliver more now, so more time to talk other stuff

[ASSISTANT]
How has it changed code reviews or design reviews on your team, if at all?

[USER]
We are using an automated review bot, it is very good at catching readability issues and nits some good catches too

[ASSISTANT]
How, if at all, has this changed how your manager tracks progress or trusts your estimates?

[USER]
I don't think so but he can see velocity is better

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Not in my field but some other critical software pieces would be better to handled by humans

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you say those critical pieces are better handled by humans?

[USER]
If it affects people's lives, such as software responsible for the electricity or water supply

[ASSISTANT]
In your own work, where do you draw the line between what should stay in human hands and what can be handed to an AI?

[USER]
More complex work which needs deep domain expertise should be still handled by humans if you ask me

[ASSISTANT]
Why is it important for you to keep those complex tasks in your own hands?

[USER]
because it is harder to understand and because of domain expertise needed, humans will make it safer

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
All the crud style softwares can be written by AI

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you want to hand off those CRUD-style projects—what’s the appeal of letting AI do them?

[USER]
Cause it is easier to understand and very straightforward

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those CRUD projects, would it change how others see your contribution on the team?

[USER]
I don't think so, in the end a human will review the work

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
To know where you need autonomy and where you don't :)

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from your own work where you wanted a lot of autonomy?

[USER]
If I work on something that needs deep domain expertise, I'd expect less autonomy, but if the  work is clearly defined and if I know the domain, I'd need less autonomy

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways to read what you said: either for deep, high‑stakes work you prefer more discussion and shared decision‑making, and for well‑understood, clearly scoped work you want more room to run without check‑ins; or the reverse. Which of these matches what you mean, or is it something else?

[USER]
both

[ASSISTANT]
Could you share one recent example of each — a time you invited more discussion on a deep, high‑stakes piece, and a time you ran mostly on your own on a clearly scoped task?

[USER]
In my recent work, there is a part of ML, DS and I don't have too knowledge about it, so I took autonomy as a helping hand

[ASSISTANT]
In that ML and data science piece, what did you actually do to bring in more discussion—who did you involve, and what parts did you decide yourself?

[USER]
my manager involved me, I decided how to interact with DS models but didn't decide how they should work

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks, and could you share a recent clearly scoped task where you mostly ran on your own, and what decisions you kept to yourself versus checked with others?

[USER]
There is a microservice that needs to be upgraded with its dependencies, I did it by my own

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through those examples. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
No, I think it will help a lot in the future too

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Do you feel we’ve covered the important points about how AI is affecting your work?

Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

When you think about those qualities you listed, which one sits at the top for you right now?

[USER]
the job should be mentally challenging

[ASSISTANT]
When you say mentally challenging, what does that look like in your day-to-day as an audio programmer?

[USER]
Every day I am facing new problems, being them bugs I need to fix or features I need to design. Every day I need to reverse engineer code systems, understand and draft logic patterns, and find appropriate solutions

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about creativity in your role, where does it show up most in your workday?

[USER]
Usually it shows up when designing a new feature. Creativity is needed to find the tidiest and most beautiful way to code a new system

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI is being used more and more for coding. I personally use it to do initial drafts of algorithms or patterns, or to convert some code to languages/API I'm not too familiar with

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent time you did that—what the task was, what the AI produced, and what you did yourself?

[USER]
Last time I used it I needed to perform some quaternion algebra to offset audio objects from the center of a room to the ceiling, while changing coordinate transform at the same time. I drafted the function and included the audio specific methods, while the AI gave me the algebraic operations

[ASSISTANT]
In that case, how did you check whether the algebraic operations it provided were actually correct?

[USER]
After briefly reviewing the code to assess it wasn't clearly wrong, I added some debug and ran it in my IDE

[ASSISTANT]
Did it make any mistakes when you tested it, and if so, how did you handle them?

[USER]
It didn't make any mistake

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind as you decided to trust its output for the math in that moment?

[USER]
I couldn't spot any obvious mistake, and the risk of there being a mistake was almost zero (the code would not have compiled, or it wouldn't have worked as expected)

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to writing the algebra yourself, how did using AI change the flow of your work?

[USER]
I always struggle to remember those specific operations, and without AI it would have taken me many tries to get it right through printing debug and setting breakpoints. This way, I can just explain the task, review the code and eventually make slight adjustments

[ASSISTANT]
In that workflow, what part felt most satisfying to you?

[USER]
Breaking down the task in the clearest way in order to obtain the best result from the AI. you need to deeply understand your problem in order to explain it

[ASSISTANT]
When you’ve had to revise what it gives you on other tasks, what does that feel like, and what stands out to you about that process?

[USER]
it's still nice, although sometimes AI can be too lengthy and wordy, both in natural language and in code. It feels like reviewing code written by an intern, or a junior SWE

[ASSISTANT]
When you saved time on that quaternion task, what did you end up doing with that time?

[USER]
I finished my task earlier than expected, and jumped on another task

[ASSISTANT]
Has there been a time when it gave you something that sent you down the wrong path or just wasn’t usable, and what did you do next?

[USER]
Yes, once it started hallucinating over some methods from an API that didn't exist. After arguing for a bit, I decided to go check the documentation to find the truth and ended up implementing the solution by myself

[ASSISTANT]
Is there any part of your work where you intentionally avoid using it?

[USER]
I try to avoid it when I'm "mentally fresh" (e.g. at the start of the day). Usually I fall back to it when my productivity goes down. So, instead of slacking off, I offload some mental work

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It enables me to do things faster, which means I can quickly support my coworkers

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent time you used it to support a coworker—what they needed, what you did, and how that interaction went?

[USER]
A co-worker asked for an automatic way to change many XML files. it wasn't a priority at that time, but I decided to quickly code a script with the help of AI to solve the problem. Without AI, it would've probably taken me a couple of hours, which means it would've needed scheduling and planning. with AI, I squeezed it in 5 minutes

[ASSISTANT]
How did your coworker respond to that script, and did it change how they turn to you or how they see your role on the team?

[USER]
they were surprised by the fast turnaround, and very grateful. Now I'm seen like the "fast and helpful programmer that does everything" (not only thanks to AI)

[ASSISTANT]
Has using it changed anything in how you and your manager set priorities or estimate timelines?

[USER]
Not really, no

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Probably the creative aspect of it. I really enjoy being able to find beautiful code solutions from a blank page

[ASSISTANT]
Why is that creative part important for you to keep?

[USER]
Because it's what I love the most about this job. Being a SWE is kinda like being a wizard, and you do magic with code

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over that creative part, how do you think it would change your role on the team or the way teammates relate to you?

[USER]
I think it wouldn't change much, but I'd need to adapt to finding creativity in how to prompt the AI to "do my job". I believe there will always be a higher level of creative direction needed. my role would probably change from SWE to prompt engineer, or something along those lines

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent moment when you felt that creative spark while coding, and what about it made it yours rather than something you’d hand off?

[USER]
I found a very beautiful solution to handle vehicle pass by sounds. the previous system was very convoluted, messy and unreliable. I spent two days thinking about the design, and came up with a very simple, rock solid system. I didn't follow any tutorial or any external input, I just sat down, analysed the problem and found a beautiful solution

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Probably all the repetitive tasks: keep data maintained, implementation, markup

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those repetitive tasks the ones you’d want to hand off—what’s the sticking point for you when you’re doing them?

[USER]
they are repetitive: you don't need to think at all

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those repetitive parts, do you think it would change how others see your contribution on the team?

[USER]
Absolutely not, everyone thinks those tasks are of low value. but they still need doing

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I'd probably tell them it means being independent from the beginning to the end of a task: doing your research, finding your solutions or contacting other area owners for advice. not relying on your manager or other senior teammates

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from recently where you had that kind of independence from start to finish, and walk me through what you actually did at each step?

[USER]
I had a bug where and alarm would keep playing after player respawn. I looked at the code, tried some speculative fixes that didn't work, then I contacted the owner of that bit of code, explained my problem and we both brainstormed some possible solution. once we were both happy, I went back to my pc, implemented the fix and subbed it

[ASSISTANT]
In that bug fix, what were the key decisions you made on your own, and where did you feel you needed input from the code owner?

[USER]
Decisions I made on my own were related to my domain (audio code). how to stop the sound, which audio object to use. I needed input from the code owner to find the best place to put my code

[ASSISTANT]
If you were coaching a new hire to build that kind of independence in an AI‑heavy environment, what habit would you tell them to practice first?

[USER]
I'd tell them to not be lazy, and try to solve a problem themselves before resorting to AI. I think you should never backseat with AI, unless you are so tired you wouldn't get any work done otherwise

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing all of this. Before we wrap up, is there anything we haven’t talked about that feels important about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
No, it's been a very thorough conversation

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a Data Analytics Manager at a leading automotive manufacturing company

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Communication, collaboration and working towards core goals

[ASSISTANT]
When you say communication, what does good communication look like day to day in your world?

[USER]
Talking or messaging people in order to collaborate and work together. It’s all about connection

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about collaboration, what makes it feel effective to you?

[USER]
When you are in sync and working towards the goal

[ASSISTANT]
When you say working towards core goals, what tells you that the team is truly aligned on those goals?

[USER]
Everyone has bought into them and understands how their role in the process will get us there

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use AI to help me write messages to team mates and for practical support like coding

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used it to draft a message to a teammate—what did it do, and what did you do?

[USER]
I had to ask a tricky question so I asked for help wording it in a way the person would be more likely to be helpful

[ASSISTANT]
In that instance, what did the tool give you back, and what did you change before you sent the message?

[USER]
It gave me a full draft. I tweaked it slightly to add personalisation

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when you first read the draft it suggested?

[USER]
I thought this is good - it was friendly and professional

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks. You also mentioned practical support like coding—can you tell me about a recent coding task where you used AI, and what parts it handled versus what you did yourself?

[USER]
I was stuck and my SQL query wasn’t returning the right results. I sent it to AI with the problem and it showed me to add in a where clause

[ASSISTANT]
When it pointed out the missing where clause, what was your gut response in that moment?

[USER]
I thought “brilliant, that’s probably right”. I tried its code and it worked. I was very happy

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time it got something wrong?

[USER]
I asked it about companies in the ETF VWRP and it got the top 10 and their % wrong

[ASSISTANT]
How did you realize those ETF details were off, and what did you do once you spotted it?

[USER]
I was comparing it to another website

[ASSISTANT]
When you spotted that discrepancy on the ETF, what did that moment do to your sense of how much to rely on it for factual lookups?

[USER]
Once I spotted it I told it and asked if it was correct. It corrected itself but it makes you doubt it a bit and feel like you need to double check other things

[ASSISTANT]
When it speeds up something like the SQL fix or the message drafting, what do you tend to do with the time you free up?

[USER]
Do my own personal things or move onto the next thing on my to do list

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking back to that tricky question, how did your teammate respond, and did the phrasing seem to change the tone of the interaction?

[USER]
It got a positive initial response and then we conversed some more whic enabled me to get what I needed

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I think it has helped me build better relationships because it helps me identify how to approach ch certain topics with certain people. It’s great to bounce ideas off

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific conversation where it shaped how you approached the topic—what guidance did it give you, and how did the other person respond?

[USER]
I wanted to get information on a specific SQL table from the data owner but I didn’t know this person. It helped me draft an initial approach message in a friendly and professional tone in order to most likely get them to help me

[ASSISTANT]
How did the data owner respond to that first message, and what stands out to you about how the exchange unfolded after that?

[USER]
They replied in a really friendly tone so it made me think the message AI helped write really set a positive tone

[ASSISTANT]
Has using it in your communication changed anything in how your manager or teammates see you or interact with you?

[USER]
I think they see me as friendlier and more approachable now

[ASSISTANT]
Do you usually let people know when a message or idea was AI‑assisted, or do you keep that to yourself—and how do you decide?

[USER]
No - I never tell anyone. I don’t want them to think less of me for seeking its support or that I’m in some way “cheating”…

[ASSISTANT]
Has there been a moment where using it in your communication backfired or felt a bit off?

[USER]
Sometimes it doesn’t feel authentic or the way I would phrase something…

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
The interactions I have with people. I would miss real human interfacing

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about those human interactions that you would not want to lose?

[USER]
It’s personal. It’s connection. It’s real

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled those person‑to‑person exchanges for you, how do you think that would change your relationships or your role on the team?

[USER]
I would be bored and feel stale. I would feel like a robot and not a human. I would be very isolated from everyone

[ASSISTANT]
What do you do in those conversations that, in your gut, you don’t think an AI could capture?

[USER]
The real human nuances, humour, just the human touch

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
The basic admin jobs. Some coding. Some of the more technical stuff. Anything that frees up my time… sending it to meetings I don’t want to go to

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those specific tasks the ones you’d want to hand off—what is it about them that you’d be glad to stop doing?

[USER]
They are boring, repetitive, don’t feel like they add value, they take too much time

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those tasks, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
I think they might start to see me as more important. It would be like AI is my PA

[ASSISTANT]
We've talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
i am a data analyst and application support engineer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
growth, making  a difference and being challenged

[ASSISTANT]
When you say growth, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
Learning new skills and learning new topics

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about making a difference, what tells you that your work is having an impact?

[USER]
Know that when a project or task is completed successfully those that were involved could not complete without you

[ASSISTANT]
When you say being challenged, what kinds of problems or situations give you that feeling?

[USER]
Problems or tasks that require me to investigate or have to learn a new skill

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
it helps me to prepare emails quicker and understand meeting details/concepts discussed in the meeting also helps with debuggin code

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used it to prepare an email? What did it do, and what did you do?

[USER]
I told it to summarise the technical points and requests discussed during the meeting so it could be used as a plan of action

[ASSISTANT]
After it produced that summary and plan of action, what did you change or add before you sent the email?

[USER]
I editted it to include some final points and to not sound so official so it was less likely to look lik ai

[ASSISTANT]
When you first read the AI’s draft for that email, what went through your mind—what parts felt spot on, and what felt off?

[USER]
The understanding of the technical details was broken down well and the tone of the msg was too profeessional

[ASSISTANT]
Did it miss anything important or get anything wrong in that summary, and if so, how did you handle it?

[USER]
no it didnt

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent time you used it to debug code. What was the issue, and how did you and the tool work together to fix it?

[USER]
it was an sql query to calculate the date in a where clause , the tool gave me several option and I chose the most simple and easiest to impletment

[ASSISTANT]
When you were choosing among those options for the SQL fix, what guided your decision in the moment?

[USER]
each option was provided with a title paragraph

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific meeting where you used it to make sense of the concepts—what was the topic, and how did you use the tool during or after the meeting?

[USER]
i used it in  meeting regarding the implementation of a cookie banner. The technical information was overwhelming sO I recorded the session and made AI transcribe it before detailing the ask from the others.

[ASSISTANT]
When you read the transcript and the summary for that cookie banner meeting, what was your gut response? What stood out to you in that moment?

[USER]
that the test and concepts were now digestable

[ASSISTANT]
After using the transcript and summary to make the cookie banner meeting digestible, what did you do next with that clarity—how did it change your next steps or your timeline?

[USER]
I picked out the points I wanted and created an email explaining the next steps.It didnt change my next steps , it allowed me to answer the technical questions that needed to be answered

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It has allowed me to not fear any teshnical  requirements because I can always ask AI to clarify it

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized you could lean on it for clarifying technical requirements, how did that change your conversations with colleagues or stakeholders?

[USER]
It allowed me to organise meetings myself and take the lead and propose solutions

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a specific meeting where you took the lead and proposed a solution—what happened in the room, and how did others respond?

[USER]
I m

[ASSISTANT]
It sounds like you were about to describe that meeting. Could you tell me what happened and how people reacted?

[USER]
I na discussion regarding JS tags i was able to question the SMEs regarding there implementation of code and see if it complies with the enterprise standard. Others we're able t respond like they were talking with a professional

[ASSISTANT]
Has using it ever created any friction or misunderstandings with teammates or clients? Tell me about a time if one comes to mind.

[USER]
Yes, the knowledge acquired made me more advanced than my co workers and they re lower understanding was starting to show

[ASSISTANT]
When you noticed your coworkers’ lower understanding starting to show, how did you navigate that with them? What did you do or say?

[USER]
I had to jump in to the conversation and clarify the details on both sodes

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
The creative part, innovation, etc

[ASSISTANT]
Why is that creative part important for you to keep?

[USER]
IT MAKES my role enjoyable and chanllenging. gives me purpose

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over that creative part, how do you think it would change your role on the team or your relationships with others?

[USER]
I would feel useless, i wouldnt know what would be expected of me. i wouldnt have anything else to do

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of a creative piece of work you want to keep for yourself? What did you do in that case?

[USER]
I came up with a data flow for a new project and how it would work and generate money. I want to innovate applcaitions to solve problems and automate

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would give the sending emails and coordinating boring tasks

[ASSISTANT]
What makes sending emails and coordinating the boring tasks the ones you most want to hand off?

[USER]
They are unfulfilling and mind numbing. its basically managing people to lazy to manage themselves

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would say autonomy means to be able to ork from where you want and to manage tasks projects when you wants as long as it gets done

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice—when you chose where and when to work on something and how it played out?

[USER]
Idaily I have many projects that are usually urgent but I decide how and which i tackle first

[ASSISTANT]
When you decide which urgent project to tackle first, what do you weigh up in that moment?

[USER]
deadlines or if a manager is involved

[ASSISTANT]
How do tools like AI affect your ability to choose how, when, and where you do your work?

[USER]
If i know I can use ai for a quick answer I will do that project first

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
Not that I can think of

[ASSISTANT]

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm a site reliability engineer managing server backends features and security

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Well paying, good benefits, related to what you already like to do

[ASSISTANT]
When you say good benefits, what does that mean to you in practice?

[USER]
Such as health benefits and retirement assist

[ASSISTANT]
When you say related to what you already like to do, what does that look like for you in your day to day?

[USER]
I like creating automation scripts, and a lot of my job is creating automation

[ASSISTANT]
When you say well paying, what tells you it’s good in your situation?

[USER]
Just looking at current job listings and salary ranges

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It helps me discover new tools, come up with infrequent code expressions faster, and debug code faster

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it to debug something—what was the issue, and how did you and the AI each contribute to fixing it?

[USER]
I was debugging why a new tool wasn't cleaning up old files faster than thirty days. The issue was a missing configuration variable and it identitfied where to add it

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, what parts did it handle and what parts did you do yourself, step by step?

[USER]
I gave it the entire config file, it said what to add and where to add it, and I manually added the variable

[ASSISTANT]
When it pointed to that missing variable and the spot to add it, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
"oh that makes sense. Hope it's a real variable"

[ASSISTANT]
After you added the variable, what happened next, and how did you check that it actually solved the cleanup issue?

[USER]
I still need to give it some time to adjust to the new cleanup policy so it's not 100% certain right now

[ASSISTANT]
Have there been times when its suggestions were off or didn’t work—what happened then, and how did you handle it?

[USER]
there have been many times where it didn't work due to certain functions and variables simply not existing. I handled it but giving the error back to the AI to correct it

[ASSISTANT]
When it gives you suggestions that turn out to be wrong, what is your gut response, and what stands out to you about how you work through it?

[USER]
My gut response is to give the error back to the AI.

[ASSISTANT]
When it does speed things up, what do you usually do with the time you save?

[USER]
I move on to other work tasks

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time it helped you discover a new tool—what was the tool, and how did you decide to try it?

[USER]
it helped me discover that Amazon supported MQ 4.2. I decided to try it because my current MQ solution was moving from free to paid

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example of an infrequent code expression you asked it for, and walk me through how you used or modified what it returned?

[USER]
As an example, I needed a grok parser to find any instance of log lines starting similar to I1230 and parse the first letter as the status and the numbers as the month and date

[ASSISTANT]
What did it give you for that grok pattern, and what changes did you make before you put it into your pipeline?

[USER]
I don't have the exact pattern on hand, but I used it as is and it worked

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It hasn't affected my working relationships

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future, is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
For now I would never hand over changes to production environment without my approval

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping your approval on production changes important to you?

[USER]
with AI making so many mistakes, it could be a disaster if it took down production

[ASSISTANT]
What would you need to see from an AI system to feel comfortable letting it execute production changes without your sign-off?

[USER]
I would need to see it being used successfully in test environments for a year, and even then only to non-critical parts

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI did make production changes without your sign‑off, how do you think that would change your role on the team or your relationships with teammates?

[USER]
assuming we actually trust it, we would continue doing other improvements to the overall system

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would give adjusting pod resources in non-prod environments

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up adjusting pod resources in non‑prod?

[USER]
seems like something relatively harmless, and AI should be good enough to see a trend of numbers to calculate an overall baseline number

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled adjusting those pod resources, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
no

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Autonomy means being able to suggest improvements and choose tasks that you like or prefer to do.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example of a time you suggested an improvement and chose to work on it—what was the idea, and what happened from start to finish?

[USER]
I noticed that during a server version upgrade that add-ons weren't upgraded. My idea was to revisit the upgrade code and do both server and add-on upgrades together. I worked with the script writer of the update code, found code to automatically update add-ons, and handed it over to the script owner

[ASSISTANT]
In that upgrade example, what decisions were yours to make, and what needed someone else’s approval?

[USER]
The need to upgrade both in one script was a mutual decision, but overall the script owner's approval was needed

[ASSISTANT]
You also mentioned choosing tasks you like. Can you share a recent time you picked a task you preferred and how you let your team know you were taking it?

[USER]
A recent time was when I preferred to update deploy train documentation to help future members run deploys easier. I didn't even let my team know because I knew it was important

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might hear what you said. One is having the say over what to work on and how to approach it day to day. The other is being held responsible for results while having wide latitude in methods. Which of these is closer to what you mean, or do you mean something else?

[USER]

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
IT and computer

[ASSISTANT]
Could you tell me a bit more about your role in IT—what kinds of projects or day-to-day tasks you handle?

[USER]
automation

[ASSISTANT]
What kinds of systems or processes are you typically automating at work?

[USER]
I mainly focus on automating repetitive tasks, like system monitoring, backups, and data handling. I also work on integrating different systems and automating workflows, especially where multiple teams need to collaborate.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job—in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job, for me, is one that offers meaningful work, opportunities for growth, a healthy work-life balance, a supportive team, and fair recognition and compensation. It’s about feeling valued and having the space to improve.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say meaningful work, what does that look like in your day-to-day?

[USER]
For me, meaningful work feels like making a tangible impact—whether it's automating a process that saves time or solving a tricky problem that improves efficiency. It’s about knowing that what I do has a purpose, like streamlining workflows so people can focus on more important tasks.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about opportunities for growth, what kinds of skills or experiences are you hoping to build through your work?

[USER]
I’d like to build more advanced technical skills, especially in areas like machine learning and AI integration, to stay on the cutting edge of automation. I’m also interested in honing my problem-solving abilities, particularly in complex system integration.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about a supportive team, what do people do or say that makes you feel genuinely supported?

[USER]
A supportive team for me is one where communication is open and honest, and people are willing to help without hesitation. It’s the little things, like offering feedback that’s constructive, sharing knowledge, or just being available when something goes wrong.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI impacts my work in a few key ways, especially when it comes to automation and problem-solving. It helps me streamline repetitive tasks, optimize system performance, and even predict potential issues before they become problems.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent example where you used AI on a specific task, and tell me what parts you did versus what the AI handled?

[USER]
I used AI to automate server monitoring, where it analyzed performance data and predicted potential failures. I set up and trained the system, fine-tuned alerts, and integrated it with our workflow.

[USER]
I used AI to automate server monitoring, where it analyzed performance data and predicted potential failures. I set up and trained the system, fine-tuned alerts, and integrated it with our workflow.

[ASSISTANT]
In that monitoring project, did it ever flag the wrong thing or miss an issue, and if so, what did you do in response?

[USER]
AI flagged the wrong thing or missed an issue. For example, it once flagged an unusually high CPU usage as a potential failure, but it was actually caused by a temporary system process that wasn’t critical.

[ASSISTANT]
What steps did you take after that false alarm to adjust the system?

[USER]
After the false alarm, I adjusted the system by refining the alert thresholds to better differentiate between temporary spikes and actual issues.

[USER]
After the false alarm, I adjusted the system by refining the alert thresholds to better differentiate between temporary spikes and actual issues.

[ASSISTANT]
When that false alarm popped up, what went through your mind and how did you react in the moment?

[USER]
I think thats enough for now,can we end there for now please

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing all of that. We can stop here. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
not really

[ASSISTANT]

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Im tier 2 helpdesk

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Able to always find the answer even if you dont know it

[ASSISTANT]
Besides being able to find the answer, what else matters to you in a good job?

[USER]
Good pay, good work life balance, great boss

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a great boss, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
a boss that understands when a task is late or doesnt get done on time due to an issue outside of my control

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about work life balance, what does that look like for you week to week?

[USER]
At least 2 days off consecutively

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use gemeni to get answers on networking topics or to vibe code programs that help me with my job

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the last time you used it on a networking issue. What was the question, and what did you do with the answer it gave you?

[USER]
Auth issue with my network portal had to clear my  cookies and cache i asked my ai what the issue was and sent a screenshot to it. It told me to clear my cookies and cache

[ASSISTANT]
After you cleared the cookies and cache, what happened next on that case?

[USER]
I was able to log in

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did it handle and which parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
i handled error gathering it handled the solution

[ASSISTANT]
When it suggested clearing cookies and cache, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
chrome settings

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned using it to write programs that help you at work. Can you tell me about the last script or tool you had it help you with, what it was for, and how you used the result?

[USER]
python script for auto portal auth

[ASSISTANT]
For that auto portal auth script, walk me through how you went from your first prompt to a working version. What steps did you take and what did it give you?

[USER]
i gave it pearl code from the wesbite i got it by recording network traffic when i log in i kept feeding it errors until it got it right

[ASSISTANT]
What was the trickiest error it produced on that script, and how did you figure out the fix?

[USER]
visual bugs cause i made the ui look like fallout

[ASSISTANT]
When you were working with AI on that script, what stands out to you about how it felt to build it that way?

[USER]
saved SOOO much time

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved?

[USER]
gamed

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Some people have a hate boner for ai so it can be annoying

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent interaction where someone’s dislike of AI came up, and what happened in that moment?

[USER]
discord artists i kind of moved past it once i mentioned ai but i try to avoid to bring up the topic. They bascailly was like oh ai sucks blah blah blah

[ASSISTANT]
How has this played out with your teammates or managers at work?

[USER]
yeah a it coworker who hates ai

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time that coworker’s view actually affected how you two worked together? What happened?

[USER]
it hasnt im good at working with people even if they disagree with me

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
no not really but then comes the question how do i get money

[ASSISTANT]
When that question about money pops up, what do you picture changing about your role if these tools could do most of the work?

[USER]
i see myself getting replaced eventually

[ASSISTANT]
When you picture getting replaced, what stands out to you about that thought?

[USER]
how money will get distrubted

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about money being distributed differently, how do you imagine that affecting your role or your day to day?

[USER]
i see myself with more free time if i dont get used as a battery first

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
dealing with customers

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up dealing with customers?

[USER]
cause i hate dealing with dumb people

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
im young im 23 lol

[ASSISTANT]
Totally. Still, if someone new asked you what it means to have autonomy in this kind of job today, what would you say?

[USER]
autonomy works with easier simpler tasks but more complex convoluted jobs require the human touch.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from your job of a simpler task where that works well, and a more complex one where you feel the human touch matters?

[USER]
having a ai take calls and then give me the info of the issues their having and one that requires the human touch would be making a ui the way a customer wants exactly

[ASSISTANT]
In that UI example, tell me about a time you did this and what choices you made that you think an AI might miss.

[USER]
i sold mod menus on the side ai cant do that do to restrctions on what its allowed to help with

[ASSISTANT]
5j3k

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for participating. You raised some ethically or legally problematic content. The interview concludes here.

Duration: 33.84 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I was a QA for software products but recently beginning to do website and app development

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Not too far of a commute, good coworkers, fair boss, good pay, must be a good fit for the resume because I am always thinking of the future not just the current day.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about good coworkers, what does that look like day to day in how people act or work together?

[USER]
A good coworker to me is someone personable that also gets their job done, and does not try to step ontop of you to climb the corporate ladder or gain benefits with anyone else. So someone who is generally kind who actually would like to get to know you and is easy to work with.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a fair boss, what makes that fair in your experience?

[USER]
A fair boss cares about you to some degree outside of work or how you are doing in life. Is not shy to do a performance review or avoid it like some people have before. Smart and encouraging/powerful presence. But not powerful in an intimidating way, but a leader everyone looks up to.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a good fit for your resume, what does that mean in practice for the kinds of roles or projects you take on?

[USER]
When I say a good fit for my resume I mean when I go to a job im not looking to spend the rest of my career there, but It will be a building block in my life if that makes sense.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI impacts my work greatly, as I am 24 and trying to work in the world of software engineering, where AI tools are taking over.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent task where you used an AI tool in your development or QA work? What did you use it for?

[USER]
I used AI to help me write unit tests for automated QA testing in javascript. We use AI tools like codex and copilot to help build apps, and AI site builders like bolt to build websites via "vibe coding".

[ASSISTANT]
In that unit test example, which parts did the AI produce, and which parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
At the beginning I started by reading documentation on Javascript, and then had the AI write unit tests based off what I wanted it to do. The unit tests were very "fluffed" and had a lot of code that was unnecessary. I began to write them myself and I reduced the lines of code in a unit test by around 5x.

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when you saw those AI-written tests were padded with extra code?

[USER]
I didnt think much of it but my engineering lead saw this in a code review and then told me that it is very poor and not efficient. I learned how to write it better and then told the AI to write further tests like I have, and from there it worked fine for the most part.

[ASSISTANT]
In that code review moment, what stood out to you about your lead’s feedback, and how did you react right then?

[USER]
He could tell clearly that I was using AI to write my tests, and I was embarrassed. He was asking me like "What selectors did you use"? and I had no idea what this was. Being embarassed led me to write my own and redeem myself in a way lol.

[ASSISTANT]
After you rewrote them and then had the AI follow your pattern, how did the quality and speed compare to doing it all yourself?

[USER]
It was about the same because I knew what the proper syntax would look like and sometimes it would try to add something other than queryselector, and I woudl have to guide the AI to do the right thing. The scripts it wrote were fine I just had to proofread and reprompt sometimes.

[ASSISTANT]
Could you walk me through a recent time you used one of those AI site builders like Bolt to do “vibe coding”? What did it actually generate, and what parts did you step in to change or add yourself?

[USER]
Yeah so I get the concept from my boss and then I take it into bolt which has a window similar to this and you tell it with a decent amount of detail so it doesnt fill it with its own ideas. It will generate a website based off your initial prompt. Frontend and backend. From there you just use the terminal to tweak and add things that you need. You can switch from frontend like browser view to code view and edit code yourself or add new files whatever you need to do. It generated essentially the whole website I just guide it.

[ASSISTANT]
When Bolt’s first pass gives you a site, what tends to be off or not quite right, and how do you handle those fixes?

[USER]
You just need to add as much context to the AI as possible but yeah it takes probably 10 "revisions" or for apps "builds" to get to a completed product

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to building a site without Bolt, how does the overall timeline change for you from brief to handoff?

[USER]
It reduces the time greatly. like 5x

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re guiding Bolt through those rounds of revisions, what does that work feel like to you in the moment?

[USER]
It feels nice to be working towards a nice finished product for my boss and I know he will like it but it doesnt feel right as an aspiring software engineer

[ASSISTANT]
What about that doesn’t feel right to you as someone building your skills — what goes through your mind in those moments when you’re mostly guiding rather than writing the code yourself?

[USER]
It feels like I am cheating my way through it, but at the same time it feels like I am following latest tech trends and the future will definitely involve AI so I try not to feel so bad about it. I like C++ which is a lower level and difficult language, so doing websites with AI just feels wrong sometimes. Like my job will be replaced eventually.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Has been fine, its been a bit annoying lately since everyone at my company is so "AI Positive" and management is trying to get people who do accounting to start vibe coding websites lol. makes me feel some type of way.

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned management encouraging folks in accounting to start vibe coding websites. How does that affect your sense of your role or standing on the team?

[USER]
Makes me feel not needed and like all my knowledge up to this point is squandered because they see accounting to be able to do the old job of a software developer

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific conversation or meeting where this came up and how people responded?

[USER]
My boss brings up having people who are not technical at all to vibe code websites. Even my coworker who recently got into game development told my boss that and he said you are wasting your time trying to learn how to write code these days.

[ASSISTANT]
What was your gut response in that moment when your boss said learning to write code was a waste of time?

[USER]
I felt like he was not entirely correct and I still feel that way. it is useful to know how to write maintainable, modular, scalable code and know good software practices. Vibe coding can definitely lead to writing bad code especially if you dont unserstand what is going on at all behind the scenes...

[ASSISTANT]
Hearing all that, has this changed how you collaborate with teammates day to day, for example how you ask for help or how people respond in code reviews?

[USER]
Yeah my engineering lead is oldschool like know how to code and write clean efficient code and my boss is more vibe coding sided so I tend to go more in depth with my engineering lead to try and show him that I am not trying to vibe code my way thru things

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Hopefully not app development. Websites are a lost cause but I enjoy creating apps with swift in visual studio and copilot.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes building apps something you want to keep doing yourself rather than handing it over?

[USER]
It makes me feel like an engineer. The levels of abstraction in terms of software for "vibe coding" tools for app development is not far along as websites. At this point you can just vibe code a website in minutes but tech has not gotten there yet for apps so I get to build and work out bugs errors handle database integration etc.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI could take over app building and do it flawlessly, how do you think that would change your role on the team or your relationships with your teammates?

[USER]
I would have to move into product management or keep my job as an engineer but utilize AI tools

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Qa for boring software products

[ASSISTANT]
What makes that kind of QA the thing you’d hand off—what is it about that work that you’re ready to let AI do instead?

[USER]
QA for boring business intelligence software is not fun. So let the AI do it. It is monotonous and not enjoyable. I am trying to become an engineer not a QA perosn.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over that QA work, do you think it would change how others see your skills or what you’re responsible for on the team?

[USER]
No beacuse I no longer work doing QA stuff so that would not be my problem

[ASSISTANT]
We've talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
To have autonomy in your job SHOULD be a means to help you, but most times autonomy will end up hurting you to save whoever is at the top more $.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice from a job you’ve had?

[USER]
Instead of building out sites for a month or two it is done in a week by 1 person. Or at taco bell there is an AI cashier taking orders. Or at the supermaket there has been self checkout for a decade. People are being replaced by these tools.

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might understand what you said — that it’s about having room to decide how you do the work, or that it’s about companies using tools to shrink teams while piling more on each person. Which of these fits what you mean, or is it something else?

[USER]
The latter explanation

[ASSISTANT]
If you were advising that young person, what specific signs would tell them they actually have room to make decisions in their work rather than it being a cost-cutting move?

[USER]
Choose your career wisely, avoid something that could be replaced by AI

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else about how AI is affecting your work that you think we haven’t covered?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. 

Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hello I am an IT Systems Administrator at an accounting firm

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Being on top of your duties and having good written and verbal communication

[ASSISTANT]
When you say being on top of your duties, what does that look like for you on a typical day?

[USER]
Reviewing the servers, responding and staying on top of completing tickets, replying to emails, helping users out who shoulder tap me. Overall reviewing of things for future projects.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about good written and verbal communication, what stands out in how you try to do that?

[USER]
Responding promptly and effectively. Being clear and not leaving things up for interpretation.

[ASSISTANT]
Is there anything else you would add as a core characteristic of a good job?

[USER]
Nope that all I can think of

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use AI for things whether that be troubleshooting an issue that I can't search online. Learning about pieces of technology or software I run into to gain more information. Users also use some AI like Gemini and ChatGPT that they sometimes ask help with working on. I've also used AI to take information and present cleaner

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used AI to troubleshoot an issue you couldn’t find online? What happened step by step?

[USER]
Yeah, I setup a new IPSec VPN for our fortigate firewall. I discovered it was working and talking to our internal network but not with a server at a branch location. I presented issue to Gemini and it helped me build a policy to allow traffic. I then added the firewall policy and tested that it was working and informed Gemini of the success.

[ASSISTANT]
In that VPN example, which parts did the AI handle and which parts did you do yourself?

[USER]
After I gave the problem and information about the network the AI then build and presented me with the firewall policy settings I'd need to add as well as the the steps in the firewall to complete.

[ASSISTANT]
When you saw the policy and steps it suggested, what went through your mind before you applied them?

[USER]
I reviewed and wanted to make sure what they were saying made sense. I then added the policies after confirming it appeared correct.

[ASSISTANT]
Has an AI ever given you steps or settings that turned out to be off for your environment? If so, what did you do next?

[USER]
Yeah when I was building the IPSec VPN tunnel it gave me some wrong information. i then lead it down the right path of what I was expecting

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized it was giving you the wrong info and you had to steer it, what was your gut response in that moment?

[USER]
My gut response was to be more thorough in my explaining so it would have a slimmer change of providing wrong solution

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to how you would have handled that VPN issue before, how did using AI change your workflow or the time it took?

[USER]
It greatly improved my workflow, I felt less like a headless chicken and more as if I had a helping hand lead me the correct way. I'd say overall I saved time compared to watching youtube videos and reading articles.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that task?

[USER]
I got a little lazy after the success and watched some sopranos at my desk

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent time you used AI to take information and present it in a cleaner way. What was the material, and what did you ask it to do?

[USER]
We are going through a Windows 10 to Windows 11 upgrade for our company computers. With our utility LanSweeper I was able to created a list of Windows 10 devices. I then took pictures of the list and had Gemini number the list and match of computers to names and turn it into a spreadsheet

[ASSISTANT]
When Gemini gave you that numbered list and spreadsheet, how did you check that the names matched the right computers, and did anything need correcting?

[USER]
I reviewed the spreadsheet with the initial list and confirmed it matched up the computers and names properly. I then had it fix one issue where some names in the original list were duplicates and I had it remove them but that was maybe my issue for not recognizing duplicates at first

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It hasn't had to much of an impact

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time a colleague or one of your users asked you for help with an AI tool? What was that interaction like?

[USER]
Yeah one user Bill was trying to use Claude to build a script for him to use and he needed help building the correct prompt

[ASSISTANT]
When Bill asked for help with the prompt, what did you do with him step by step, and how did the script turn out in the end?

[USER]
I talked with Bill and gathered all necessary information I then built the prompt with all that information and our goal and it returned the correct script

[ASSISTANT]
How do your managers view you using AI on the job—have they encouraged it, set any boundaries, or mostly stayed hands off?

[USER]
They are aware and are fine with it being used but if it is used they've repeated to employees to double check and review it to make sure there are no errors or issues

[ASSISTANT]
Has AI changed who people come to for help on your team, or who you turn to when you get stuck?

[USER]
I've not seen any change in people coming to my team for help but I tend to find myself using AI for solutions before googling the issue more

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I would never want to hand over the actual hands on problem solving to AI. As a core part of my job that being taken away from me would diminish my value to the firm

[ASSISTANT]
Why is the hands‑on problem solving important for you to keep?

[USER]
It is a skill that I have built up and is very important in my day to day functions and if that were taken away I would have less ability that I bring and it could cost me my job

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over the hands‑on problem solving, how do you think it would change your role on the team or your relationships with coworkers and users?

[USER]
I think my role would be reduced or my job entirely. I think it would lead me to deal less with users and make leadership question if I am needed anymore

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily hand over to an AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would hand over to AI the task of doing maitenance activities like rebooting servers and installing updates for servers or programs

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to hand over those maintenance activities?

[USER]
They aren't difficult to do but can be time consuming

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those maintenance tasks, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
No not really people don't really recognize that stuff

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
The ability to move freely from tasks and not be crunched from employees or tasks

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from a recent week of what that looks like in practice for you?

[USER]
I was able to recently jump from tickets to building the IPSec VPN to Windows upgrades without someone forcing me to accomplish things first or in a specific way.

[ASSISTANT]
When you decide to switch between tickets, VPN work, and upgrades, what cues help you choose what to do next without someone telling you?

[USER]
I understand and can figure out what is pressing and if something can wait or just going off priorities I can jump how I feel when I need to.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you describe a time when you didn’t have that kind of freedom, and what got in the way?

[USER]
It would be at my last job working at an MSP where I was forced into dropping everything to take care of a call or ticket. It was a lot more hectic and I didn't have the ability to manage a consistent schedule.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
Nope I've covered everything

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a software engineer so I develop tons of code every single day

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Make sure that the coding quality and structure are clear and understandable so if needed other can work on it. Make sure to architect every step and every function that you develop for a software so it has a well designed structure. Document every single new function that you develop. Give reviews to coworker's work so they can develop and grow in the company and finally make sure to QA every new code developed and have unit tests for every single part of your development.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about a good job overall, which of the things you mentioned feels most essential to you personally?

[USER]
A Clear, Understandable and High Coding Quality and Structure

[ASSISTANT]
What makes that stand out to you—can you tell me about a recent moment when you saw code that really met that bar, and what you noticed about it?

[USER]
Because without that people will judge your work and not trust on your work even though it does its job

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
For me, AI has impacted positively at my work. Because it helps me on being more creative about the solutions that I create for the problems that I face at work. Beyond that, for documentations it helps a lot to use AI in order to not spend time reviewing stuff and beyond, it helps you on the process of learning new skills, obtaining knowledge and info gathering.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent task where you used it, step by step, and tell me which parts you did and which parts the AI handled?

[USER]
So, for example, recently I was developing a new function for the software that my company owns. Then, I was thinking in an idea to solve a problem that I was facing, btu to not spend time developing and then ending up not working or failing the solution, I decided to explain the code and the problem that I was facing and then the idea I was wanting to implement, and then asked the AI if it was the right decision to take on that situation, then the AI answered that it was not a good solution and then provided me a new way to look at the problem and then from that I created another idea that then the AI said that it would work for that case and then I went to develop the code for the solution and once implemented it really did work in the end for the result that I wanted. So, the AI could have been wrong about the first solution, however let's go for the side that it wasn't, it probably saved me an hour or 2 that I would spend developing and testing until I understood what was going wrong and with AI assistance, I ended up saving those 2 hours that I would have wasted.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, what was the alternative approach the AI suggested, and what did you end up keeping or changing when you wrote the code?

[USER]
It made me think in another direction from my thinking process was going through, basically I thought that the problem was in the front end references when in reality the problem was in the back end the entire time.

[ASSISTANT]
When it pointed you away from the front end and toward the back end, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
At that moment, I was grateful to live in a reality that I could use an AI like that, as a assistant to help me in those problems during the software development

[ASSISTANT]
In that backend fix case, did it generate any code for you, or was it mainly guiding your reasoning about where to look and how to approach it?

[USER]
No, it did not generate code, because I just explained the scenario and the situation because I could not provide the code due to a NDA, it just gave recommendations of how I could think in order to solve the issue that I was facing.

[ASSISTANT]
When you saved those one or two hours, what did you end up doing with that time?

[USER]
I actually used those 2 hours to implement the correct solution and not the one that would have been a failure.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent time you used it for documentation, and walk me through what it produced and what you kept or changed?

[USER]
Sure, I ended releasing a new version for the company's software and there was a lot of changes when compared to the previous version. so because of that, I ended up writing down a update notes for the customers, so they could understand what is new in this new version. But I am not the best in grammar and writing, but as the main developer on this new version, I was the best choice to write it down. But at some points, I was aware that there were some errors that needed to be fixed. So, I used AI to read and analyze the entire sketch that I wrote and asked it to put in the best grammar and that would look like a high quality update notes design and then it provided me. I read it through and notice how better that version was and then I published it.

[ASSISTANT]
When you reviewed the AI-edited release notes, what stood out to you, and how did it affect your confidence when you hit publish?

[USER]
I notice that even though it changed a lot of the format, style and grammar, the facts were still there. All the information were still there just in a much better way.

[ASSISTANT]
Have you had a time when it gave you an answer that turned out to be wrong or misleading? What did you do in that situation?

[USER]
Sometimes, when I asked it about certain facts that happened too recent and the database was not updated, so the information was not up to date.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It did not affect at all.

[ASSISTANT]
When you do code reviews or planning with teammates, has using AI changed anything about those conversations or how you split work?

[USER]
No, when I review codes, I try to do the best of judgement with no influence of external sources, just based on the knowledge and understanding that I have, so I can give a unbiased and truthful review.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I think I would never give anything fully to the AI to do. Because I feel like AI as an assistant is a amazing tool but AI as a developer could give super bad results. That is my philosophy at least.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes it important for you to keep a human in the loop on every part—what do you see going wrong if an AI took over end to end?

[USER]
Because as humans can make mistakes, AI can as well. So, because of that I feel like AI should be used as a tool/assistant only in all occasion, at least for my job.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI did take over a whole feature from start to finish, how do you think that would change your role on the team or the trust others place in your work?

[USER]
I think it would decrease the value of workers in the market, which is something that we do not want to happen.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily hand over to an AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Like I said before, none.

[ASSISTANT]
What is the main reason you would not hand off even small, routine tasks to an AI?

[USER]
Because I see AI just as an assistant or tool for me to use with me in control of it.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I feel that autonomy would be to be independent at your job with no one telling you how to do a certain thing or to follow a certain procedure. Being autonomous at work is basically working by your own procedures and decision-making process.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you share a recent example when you worked that way and made the call yourself, and walk me through what you decided and why?

[USER]
Well, because I work in a startup company and our software development team are quite small, I end up having that autonomy all the time.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific decision on your current project where you set the approach without checking with anyone first—what the options were, what you chose, and what happened after?

[USER]
Sure, for example, when we started developing one settlement of the application, I was considered to decide which front end programming language, I would like to use for the front end development of the application, then I said that I would research it and bring them an answer in the next day, I end up going for react.js based on that research, and everyone said okay, if you feel comfortable with it, let's do it in your way, showing and demonstrating trust on my work, giving me all the autonomy to do my job the way I wanted.

[ASSISTANT]
On a typical week, what kinds of decisions do you make entirely on your own, and where are the boundaries where you check in with someone before moving ahead?

[USER]
Coding paths decisions. Software Architecture decisions. Documentation. Usage of AI and much more stuff.

[ASSISTANT]
When there are constraints like company standards or client requirements, how do you balance that with making your own calls day to day?

[USER]
Well, client requirement are the most important in a company to attend, so I take a look and verify which ones should be implemented for everyone and which ones are not relevant at all for our software and then decide how to act after a plan is made

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]

Interview 77
Username: 60a9610cae689e66af400f01
Date: 12/12/2025 18:56:28
Duration: 74.89 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hello there. 

Sure, let me tell you a bit about myself and what I do for work. I am a Software Engineer for almost 4 years now. My work involves developing and maintaining software applications. Based on the topic, I think AI definitely has an impact on the work that I do today.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I think the characteristics will involve a good work/life balance. This means that you get to work at a reasonable time that works for you (e.g. have the ability to start early and finish early or start late and finish late). There is also flexibility in terms of how you work and where you work so that means being able to work from home as well as the office (a hybrid style of working). From the job itself, I think the other characteristics would involve having a good team around you and they are able to support you when you need them to. The job itself should also be stable in terms of having a solid structure that doesn't have a high employee turnover which indicates stability. I also think it's important to think about the benefits of working, this means a strong competitive salary for the job that you are doing as well as additional employee benefits like a company bonus which motivates you to work hard in the role too.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for laying that out. Of the things you mentioned, which two or three matter most to you day to day, and why?

[USER]
I think the number one thing that matters to me the most is the flexibility of when I work and where I work. This is important because it gives me the option to adjust my working hours whenever I feel like and I can work remotely and from the office based on my own choices. Of course, I would still need to attend the office however I get to choose what days to attend which is important so that it gives me flexibility to adjust based on my schedule out of work too.

The second thing I would say is a very supportive environment where I can get the support from others whenever I need it the most. I think this is important because it allows me to feel confident in the role that I am doing and allows me to communicate openly with others in the team. I would feel more comfortable working in a place where I can get guidance on how I am doing as well as get the feedback that I need in order to improve myself.

[ASSISTANT]
Earlier you mentioned stability and pay — what do those mean to you in practice?

[USER]
Stability means the job is stable, the team structure doesn't change very often. There isn't a lot of employee turnover which suggests people like to stay in the company for longer. Pay is important because it's probably the biggest factor in why I am working in the company in the first place. If the pay isn't competitive then it's highly likely that I would look for a new role in a different place where the salary expectations meets my needs based on the role that I am doing.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I think AI has definitely impacted my work a lot. From a software development perspective, I can say that AI is now fully integrated into most of our development environments where we perform coding for example GitHub Copilot is now heavily used as part of the development to help us be more productive and get things done faster. It's easier to use AI to help with mundane or repetitive tasks and I think it helps get things done faster since you can easily troubleshoot problems when it comes to coding. It has also helped me to write emails faster as well so there's definitely a lot of ways that I have been using AI without realising it.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent coding task where you used Copilot? What were you trying to build or fix?

[USER]
A recent coding task where I used Copilot is writing unit tests. This was a repetitive task and I wanted some help to identify edge cases that I may have missed. Copilot was used to help me speed up the process, I simply told it to continue from my existing unit tests and it helped me to brainstorm additional tests that I did not consider.

[ASSISTANT]
In that unit test example, which parts did Copilot generate, and which parts did you write or change yourself?

[USER]
Copilot had generated the initial test scaffolding structure and edge cases. However, I did not trust it blindly and verified what Copilot had suggested. I refined it so that it only makes sense in the application context. This means that I made sure that the tests covered the right behaviour and not just what Copilot had assumed. There is something called context which you can provide to Copilot which helps it understand what kind of things it needs to work on however this isn't always accurate so I needed to check it myself as well.

[ASSISTANT]
Did Copilot make any mistakes in that session, and what did you do when you spotted them?

[USER]
One behaviour that I did notice is that it sometimes duplicated the same tests or wrote them that were not meaningful. I deleted redundant tests and kept only the ones that added value because Copilot doesn't know the business rules so it needed some guidance on filling those details.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were reviewing and pruning those tests, what went through your mind in the moment?

[USER]
Whenever I review Copilot's code, I made sure that to double check the output was correct. I also thought about our team's style and conventions. This means I had to check that it was consistent with our existing codebase.

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing those tests with Copilot change the time it took and the flow of your work compared to how you handled tests before?

[USER]
It made my time much more productive. I didn't need to spend time typing since Copilot handled most of the initial boilerplate and test suggestions. I spent the time instead with refining what the output was. Overall, it made me more focused and I didn't feel burned out during the process since I didn't need to put a lot of energy into it.

[ASSISTANT]
Has there been a time when using AI noticeably changed the outcome of a piece of work for you, for better or worse? Can you walk me through what happened?

[USER]
I think at the very beginning when AI was just introduced, I was still trying get familiar with it. At that time, AI was still using older models that weren't very good and I had doubts about it because there wasn't any options like providing it with context so I wasn't even sure if it was able to understand exactly what it was working with. The output could sometimes work and other times not work. What I mean is that it would sometimes provide suggestions and when I tried those suggestions, it wouldn't work because the AI just made it up and that doesn't actually exist if that makes sense.

[ASSISTANT]
When it gave you suggestions that didn’t actually exist, what was your gut response, and how did you handle it in the moment?

[USER]
When it didn't work, I would simply Google it to see exactly if it existed. When I realised that it didn't, then I just shrugged it off as it's AI and it can get things right or wrong. I didn't give up with AI, I still used it whenever I needed to. These moments just makes me realise that AI still can get things wrong and I shouldn't just rely it on all the time but try to diversify where I get help from.

[ASSISTANT]
When you save time using AI on tasks like tests, what do you typically do with that time?

[USER]
It allows me to focus on other things like use the time for personal development and upskilling. I can also use it to help others if they are struggling with any of their tasks. It also allows me to perform other activities on the side like reading and responding to emails, messages etc. It saves me time to do other things that normally would need to be kept on hold until I had got my task done.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I don't think AI has affected my working relationships in any way. The only thing that I can thing of is that our workplace allows the use of AI. It's now integrated as part of our development environment so AI usage is encouraged. I think it helps us to get things done faster and helps us come up with more innovative solutions that we might not have known about before. Overall, it's just more productive and if we were not to use it then we would simply be at a disadvantage.

[ASSISTANT]
In code reviews, have you noticed any shifts in how teammates give feedback when AI had a hand in the code?

[USER]
Code reviews have remained the same. The only thing different is that AI is now part of the code review process, it is used to do a sense check and may ask questions or raise things if it sees "clear" mistakes or issues in the written code. This helps a real person also judge the code as well because they would see the AI comments and then allows them to make up their own judgement. Basically, AI now helps us get more insight into the written code and it's basically a much more stronger way to ensure that our code is correct and does what it needs to do.

[ASSISTANT]
Has your manager’s expectations around speed or scope changed since your team started using AI?

[USER]
No, I don't think expectations around speed or scope have changed since the introduction of AI. It's still the same. AI is there just for us to get things done. Now whether it's making us more productive or not, the speed or scope hasn't changed. We haven't reached a stage where AI is dominating the field yet so the expectation is that we still work at normal speed.

[ASSISTANT]
Have there been any moments where using AI changed how you collaborate with a teammate, like during pairing or handoffs? Tell me about one.

[USER]
Yes, I have had lots of collaboration with team mates. One example is when we are struggling to understand how to get something done, it might be something simple or complex. We might look at Google to find a solution but if we aren't able to get anywhere then we are encouraged to use AI if it helps us progress and get somewhere. I think by reaching out to AI, there has been a few times where it has helped us get the answer what we were looking for as long as we provide the relevant context. For example, we were working with an unfamiliar file extension that required a specific syntax tag. We didn't know what the tag was so we used AI to troubleshoot the issue and eventually figured it out.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future. Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I think the coding aspect is still something that I enjoy doing. I wouldn't want to hand it over to an AI even if it could do it perfectly because then our roles as a software developer would definitely be at a risk. I like to use AI to help me write code from time to time as well because it gives me multiple approaches on how to tackle a problem and it's always interesting to see what ways I could have solved it.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is doing the coding yourself something you want to keep, specifically in relation to how AI is used on your team?

[USER]
Coding is something that I have always enjoyed. I just like to solving problems that require a lot of thinking and thought process behind it. It's like being an architect where you get to choose exactly how your code behaves. Plus, I think if I were to hand it over to an AI then I would definitely lose my coding skills. It's clear that if you don't practice something in the long term then you will eventually lose the skill so I think keeping myself refreshing in code just benefits me since I will be able to retain those skills instead of losing them.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI did most of the coding on your team, how do you think that would change your relationships with teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
If AI did all of the coding then I think it would definitely change how the team works. Probably more expectations to ensure the AI is completing the work and the scope and speed will be increased. I also think non technical people will start to think that we don't do much at work and probably will think of letting some of us go since AI is doing most of the work. I would definitely think my role will be limited and I would eventually lose it since I wouldn't have a lot of responsibility left if AI took over.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I want AI to be my personal assistant. Basically I would really love it if it could handle all the boring stuff for me that I don't like doing. Maybe respond to messages, emails, schedule meetings so that I literally can simply focus on doing my actual job rather than the boring stuff that I don't like doing. I tend to think that writing emails, responding to messages does take time so if AI could handle all of that then it would definitely make me more productive and get things done since I don't need to worry about any of those.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those communications the right fit for AI, compared to other parts of your job?

[USER]
These communications are usually just responding to people's messages and sometimes emails. It wouldn't be anything overly complex however if it were then I would simply take over from the AI. Other parts of my job might be mentoring junior developers, and I don't think AI will be able to help as much as I can because that probably requires more context around our existing application estate and how we work which the AI wouldn't really know about.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over your emails and messages, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
Probably, because AI speaks in a very AI standard way. I think it would definitely make the human interaction feel robotic however I do hope there is a way to add "personality" to our AI assistant so that it can replicate exactly how my messages/emails are written. Perhaps, it can use my existing messages as a way to understand how it should communicate with other people (based on how I do it). In that case then nobody will ever be able to know whether it's an AI or myself!

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I still think we haven't reached the full use case of AI yet. This means we still have autonomy to work how we want to work. We have the option to use AI or not use it. But it's evident that using AI is much more productive and better in the long-term. There's simply a lot of things that you can learn with AI and you also learn to see solutions in a different way which you would not if you didn't use it. Autonomy for us is still to be able to complete tasks the way we want to do it. Unless that changes anytime soon, I would still say joining the field is still worth it and it will definitely take some time before we get to see the full use of AI.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from a typical day of what that looks like in practice — a moment when you decide how to tackle a task, with or without AI?

[USER]
I generally think about completing the task by myself first. I also think about what other things I need to get done today. If it's something that I feel that I want to get done quickly then I would probably think about using AI just to give me some time to get ideas and possibly find a solution. It just depends on how much my current workload is. If I feel overloaded then I am probably more likely to use it.

[ASSISTANT]
Think back to a recent task you deliberately kept AI out of. What was it, and what tipped the balance for you?

[USER]
I was working with confidential data that shouldn't be provided to an AI. I wanted to write an email with the help of AI however since the email would have confidential information this tipped me not to use AI at all. In the end, I didn't write the email with the help of AI and just used my own writing style to write it.

[ASSISTANT]
On a day with tight deadlines or strict guidelines, what room do you still have to make your own calls about how to do the work?

[USER]
We still have rooms on how to do the work. However, we do have a meeting scheduled so that everyone is clear on what the expectations are and when it is going to get completed when there are strict deadlines. However, I think these calls generally do take up some time so I sometimes do wonder if having shorter calls might be better so that we can spend the time to complete the work.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work before we wrap up?

[USER]
Sure, I can add that AI has definitely come a long way in the last few years. It seems that we are getting much more better and smarter AI models in our work now. These seem to be better at understanding the context and able to provide with more reliable results compared to what I've seen in the past. I am not sure exactly which way AI is headed next but would be interesting to see in the next few years on how it would impact our work and what kind of changes we would need to make in order to accommodate it.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. Do you feel we’ve covered the important ways AI is affecting your work, or is there anything else you want to add before we finish?

[USER]
I think we've covered some good points and discussed how AI is affecting my work. From my side, I think I have mentioned all the points that I can think of. Is there anything else you want to ask?

[ASSISTANT]

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a systems architect for an educational technology company.  I share responsibilities with the development team and devops/it

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Meaningful work, opportunities for growth, positive work environment

[ASSISTANT]
When you say meaningful work, what makes it meaningful for you in practice?

[USER]
meaningful work should have purpose and impact.  I prefer work that contributes to make the company's goals more successful

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about opportunities for growth, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
Earlier on I would say opportunities for growth would include career advancement, but I have reached the pinnacle of my career path without moving to a much larger company.  For me currently, growth includes the ability to learn new technologies, skills, languages, etc and not doing the same repetitive tasks year-over-year

[ASSISTANT]
When you think of a positive work environment, what stands out in your day to day?

[USER]
My direct manager is one of the partners of the company and I have received a lot of support from him and other partners throughout my time at this company.  Clear communication on what needs to be done and feedback on previous results.  The feeling of family between employees/employers is also important

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I have used AI for a long time, we used ML with a few products we developed over the past 10 years.  I use it daily now specifically for coding so it has a huge impact in how I work everyday

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent coding task where you used AI, step by step? What did you ask it to do, and what did you do yourself?

[USER]
I am working on a R&D project to introduce an development-time orchestration tool written by Microsoft called Aspire.  I have used generative AI to help think through ideas on how we could implement different parts of the tool and also have used it for troubleshooting when things failed to work after updates

[ASSISTANT]
In that troubleshooting after an update, what did you share with the AI, what did it give you back, and what did you end up changing in your code or config?

[USER]
I used Claude Code within my project, so it has direct access to the code without needing to copy/paste into a website.  When troubleshooting I usually try to give as much details as possible like urls to documentation, error messages, thoughts on what I believe might be the root cause of the issue.  

In the exact issue from my last troubleshooting session, it gave me multiple options on how to fix the error with pros and cons of each option.  I ended up selecting the preferred option it gave and it went and modified the code for me directly

[ASSISTANT]
When it offered multiple options and then changed the code itself, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
I like having multiple options when they are available, obviously that doesn't always happen.  The way claude code is setup, it asks for permissions before changing the code and I can always revert using my Git source control

[ASSISTANT]
In that session, did it make any mistakes or suggest anything you later rejected, and how did you handle that?

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a software developer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
in my view a good job is one that gives people a meaningful degree of autonomy, fair compensation and the ability to grow without being overwhelmed .

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a meaningful degree of autonomy, what does that look like for you in the day to day?

[USER]
a meaningful degree of autonomy according to me means having control over how i approach my work rather than simply executing tasks exactly as prescribed.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say fair compensation, what does fair look like to you in practice?

[USER]
it means being paid in line with the industry standards for my skills and experience with clear and transparent criteria for how pay is set. It also includes regular adjustments for inflation and maker changes and benefits that support a stable descent quality of life.

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about the ability to grow without being overwhelmed, what does that look like for you?

[USER]
For me, growing without being overwhelmed means having opportunities to learn new skills or take on more responsibility, but at a pace that’s manageable. It looks like being given challenges that stretch me without constant pressure or unrealistic deadlines, and having support like mentorship, time to learn, or clear guidance when I’m moving into something new. It’s growth that feels steady and supported, not chaotic or exhausting.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
as a software dev, AI has started to shape my work in a few significant ways. On the positive side tools like code assistants help me move faster. They can generate boilerplate code, suggest solutions and help me catch bugs earlier which frees up time for more complex or creative problem solving. They are especially helpful when I'm exploring unfamiliar libraries or trying to understand legacy code. At the same time, AI can add new pressures like there's often an expectation to be more productive because these tools exists, or to constantly stay updated as they evolve.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used a code assistant on a specific task, step by step? What did you do, and what did it do?

[USER]
The last time I used a code assistant was when I needed to write a small data processing script. I started by typing out a rough description of what i wanted the function to do. The assistant immediately suggested a full function outline which gave me a descent starting point. I accepted part of it but changed a few details fit what I actually needed. Then I wrote a test, and the assistant filled in a couple of the assertions for me. When the tests fails, it suggested where the logic might be off which really helped me spot a small mistake faster. In the end, I still reviewed everything myself but it sped up the routine parts of the task

[ASSISTANT]
In that script example, did it make any mistakes or suggest something that didn’t fit your context? What did you do when that happened?

[USER]
yes it did suggest a few things that didn't fit my context. For example, it used a data structure that wasn't appropriate for the data set I was working with. when that happened, I ignored its suggestion and rewrote that part myself. I treated its output more as s tarting point rather than something to rely on blindly.

[ASSISTANT]
When it helped you spot that small mistake, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
my first reaction was just a relief. I had been staring at the code a bit, so when it pointed out the likely issue, it felt like oh right it makes total sense kinda thing. It was a mix of appreciation that t caught something I missed and a little annoyance that i hadn't spottled it myself. Bu mostly it just felt helpful.

[ASSISTANT]
When you used it on that script, what did you do with the time you saved?

[USER]
I used the extra time to focus on testing and refining the script. Instead of getting stuck on the boilerplate code, i could double check edge cases, improve readability and make sure it actually worked with real data. It felt like I was using my time more on meaningful tasks rather than repetitive ones.

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned new pressures to be more productive because these tools exist. How does that show up for you in the day to day?

[USER]
ammm day to day it shows up as this subtle expectations that I should be moving faster than before. If a task takes longer I sometimes catch myself thinking, shouldnt AI have made this quicker or wonder if others expect me to deliver more because I am using these tools. It's not always said out loud but it's always there in the back of your head and it feels kind of pressure to constantly be efficient and not fall behind.

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re exploring an unfamiliar library, what parts do you let the tool draft, and what parts do you insist on doing yourself?

[USER]
when i am doing that, I usually let the tool draft boilerplate code, example usage or basic function templates. I also let it suggest common patterns or syntax I might not remember. But i insist on writing the core logic, handling the edge cases and deciding how.

[ASSISTANT]
How does using the assistant affect your confidence in the result?

[USER]
Using the assistant gives me mixed feelings about confidence. On on side, it helps catch simple mistakes so I feel a bit more reassured that I haven't overlooked something obvious. But on the other hand, I don't fully trust its suggestions, so I still double check everything myself. Overall, it boosts my confidence in small ways but doesn't replace my own judgment.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Ai hasn't changed my relationships dramatically but it has shifted the vibe a little. There's a bit more talk about productivity and who uses which Tools and sometimes it feels like people compare themselves based on how efficient they are with the AI.  At the same time, it also related moments of collaboration sharing prompts, so i feel its a mix of mild pressure

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific interaction with a colleague around AI that stands out to you? What happened?

[USER]
sure. one interaction that stands out was when teammates asked me for help using a code assistant for the first time. They were struggling to get it to generate the right function and when i walked them through how to prompt it effectively and how to check its suggestions. By the end they were more confident and could use it independently. It felt good to share tips but it also reminded me that some people feel stressed about these tools first.

[ASSISTANT]
Has anything changed in how your manager talks about goals or pacing since these tools came into your team?

[USER]
yes, a little. since these AI tools became more common on the team, there's sometimes more emphasis on speed and output in meeting. and phrases like we should leverage these tools to move faster comes up. It is usually framed positively but it shifts the sense of pacing making it feel like tasks are expected to be completed more quickly than before.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
yes I'd never want to hand over the parts of my job that involve real judgment like designing systems or making trade offs or deciding what's worth building in the first place. Even if an AI could do those things perfectly, i feel as humans we have to stay accountable for them

[ASSISTANT]
Why is it important for you personally to keep those decisions, rather than letting an AI handle them?

[USER]
because those decisions are where my experience, a values and understanding of the context usually matter. They are the parts of the job that feel meaningful and they let me shape the work not just execute it. If i gave that up, i would feel more like a passenger than someone who's actively contributing for the outcome.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over those kinds of decisions, how do you think it would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
I think it would make my role feel a lot smaller. If an AI were making the key decisions then i would probably end up just implementing whatever it decided which would make the work feel more mechanical. it could also create the distance with the team as there would be fewer discussions, fewer debates and less collaboration because the direction would already be set by the AI.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would hand over the repetitive tedious tasks things like writing boilerplate code, dealing with routine debugging or cleaning up data formats. Those tasks don't require much creativity and they can be time consuming so i would be glad to let and AI take them off my plate.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those repetitive tasks for you, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
I think it might change things a bit. people might expect me to take on more complex work since the routine stuff is handled, which could be positive. but there's also a chance that some of the invisible efforts i used to put it like cleaning up messy data or untangling small bugs would go unnoticed now, since an AI would be doing it quietly in the background. overall, i think people would still value my contribution, but the baseline expectations might shift upwards.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve covered a lot. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them that autonomy today means having space to make your own judgments choosing how to approach problems, managing your own pace, and shaping the direction of your work even with AI tools around. It's about using those tools on your terms and not letting them dictate how you think or work. Real autonomy is still being trusted for your expertise and not just your efficiency.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from the last month of what that looks like in practice? A moment where you chose your own approach and used the tools on your terms.

[USER]
sure. a recent example  was when i had to add a new feature to an internal tool. Instead of starting with the AI assistant i first sketched out the design myself like how the data should flow, what the edge cases were and which parts of the codebase I wanted to refactor first. Once I had that mapped out, I used AI assistant to only for small pieces like drafting a helper function. I ignored it's bigger architectural suggestion because they dint fir the constraints I knew about. It felt like i was steering the work and AI was just helping with the boring parts.

[ASSISTANT]
That makes sense. How do you tell, in the moment, that you are using the tools on your terms rather than the tools setting the approach?

[USER]
i usually check by asking myself that am i deciding the strategy or am i just following what the tools suggests. If i am sketching the design, choosing the logic and only letting the AI the boring parts I know i am in control. If i find myself following its suggestions without questioning them that's when i realize the tool is starting to set the approach instead of me.

[ASSISTANT]
When product requirements or compliance rules narrow your options, what helps you still feel like you’re steering rather than just following along?

[USER]
even when requirements rules are strict, is still feel in control when i can decide how to meet them. choosing the implementation details, optimizing the workflow or finding creative ways to make the solution cleaner and efficient helps me steer.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else about how AI is affecting your work that we have not talked about yet?

[USER]
one thing that I'd add up is that AI sometimes changes how I plan my learning or growth. because some tasks can now be automated, I spend more time thinking where I want to focus my skill development like tackling more complex problems or learning new frameworks rather than just getting through routine work. It's subtle but it shifts not just what i do to day, but how i think about my long term career.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. Is there anything else about AI’s impact on your work that you’d like to add before we wrap up?

[USER]
no. all set

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a data manager, I focus on managing my team, from database level, azure and analysts on bi

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good work life balance, happiness and the feeling of achievement

[ASSISTANT]
When you say work life balance, what does that look like for you in a typical week?

[USER]
Finishing on time and having the energy to keep work inside work and leisure in my free time

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about happiness at work, what tends to bring that on for you?

[USER]
When there is good communication and everybody gets in with what they need to without the drama

[ASSISTANT]
What gives you that feeling of achievement—what needs to happen in a day or week for you to feel you really accomplished something?

[USER]
Doing something that i didn't feel capable of doing and then achieving it. Or helping the company in a significant way with our projects

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It makes is easier, we save a lot of time every day with Ai

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it at work—what was the task?

[USER]
I used it for some SQL scripting, writing it could take me a few hours but I could do it within minutes with Ai

[ASSISTANT]
In that SQL example, what did the AI generate and what did you handle yourself?

[USER]
It generated most of the script i just inputted the tables and correct columns and aliases

[ASSISTANT]
Did it make any mistakes or misinterpret anything, and if so, how did you catch and handle that?

[USER]
No it was fine

[ASSISTANT]
When it worked on the first try for that SQL script, what went through your mind?

[USER]
I thought this has saved a lot of time for me to get on with other work

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved that day?

[USER]
I used it to progress other important areas of worl

[ASSISTANT]
How does doing that kind of SQL work with AI compare to how you used to do it before?

[USER]
It means I could find mistakes easily and I can also script super fast.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say you can find mistakes easily now, how do you spot them in practice?

[USER]
If there is a particular function that has failed in a large script I can copy it into Ai and it will flag the mistake

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned managing a team—does AI come into play when you coordinate or review your team’s work?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re using it this way, what’s your gut response—does it feel satisfying, routine, or something else altogether?

[USER]
Nothing comes to mind

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It hasn't really

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Yes, I would never have it speak to customers on our behalf

[ASSISTANT]
What makes speaking to customers something you want to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
Its more warming and sincere to have a person represent the company. Ai can assist for any questions that may be asked but a colleague needs to be present

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over those conversations, how do you think it would change your relationships with clients or your role on the team?

[USER]
It could be frustrating if the Ai gets it wrong or cant answer the questions leaving customers baffled

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Scripting, database management

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you want to hand over scripting and database management—what’s the main reason you’d gladly let AI handle those?

[USER]
Because it would save so much time for everyone in the team

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled scripting and database management, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
Non

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
To make manual task simpler to free up time for us to work on other projects where it needs human interaction and input

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from a recent week of how you decided what to keep for yourself and what to hand to AI?

[USER]
Yes if it was long process I will try and give it to Ai, and anything regarding human interaction I would deal with myself

[ASSISTANT]
Could you walk me through a specific project from last week, step by step, with one task you handed to AI and one you kept yourself, and what you actually typed or fed into the AI?

[USER]
I dont have one myself. I have been managing my teams as of lately

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might understand what you said. Do you mean it’s about having the say over which tasks you streamline with AI and which you keep, or more about having space to focus on the parts that need human interaction?

[USER]
About focusing on human interaction

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers!

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
IT Consultant

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. What kinds of projects do you typically work on as an IT consultant, and what does a usual week look like for you?

[USER]
mainly 3rd-2nd-1st line support, configuring new equipment and some more involved project work as our internal IT offering evolves

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
a resolution to a problem in good time

[ASSISTANT]
Besides getting to a solution quickly, what else makes a job good in your eyes?

[USER]
friendly and not condecending to the client

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about a day when you went home really satisfied, what about the work made it a good day for you?

[USER]
having resolved all the support tickets possible and having achieved a good amount in the day

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
it hasn't really encroached into my day to day work but other job roles at our company are using it and therefore we have to police what AI tools are/aren't allowed within our tenant

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you had to assess or block an AI tool in your tenant, step by step? What did you do first?

[USER]
we had a seemingly random AI note taker join various zoom meetings and nobody on the call took ownership (otter ai), we had to research what/where/who this service was, understand what and where the data was stored, make a decision on if this was within our policy terms and then find a way to put a stop to it randomly joining our zoom meetings if it was deemed unfit for our purpose ... we then put out comms across our organisation to advise on the 'breach' and our action taken along with our ever evolving guidelines on AI usage with personal data

[ASSISTANT]
In that incident with the Zoom note taker, which parts did you handle yourself, and who else, if anyone, was involved in the investigation or decision?

[USER]
just me but my line manager (head of IT) discussed and confirmed the policy guidelines

[ASSISTANT]
When you first noticed that note taker in the Zoom, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
that we had a data breach / spy etc and that it was on me personally to ensure we were 'safe'

[ASSISTANT]
What concrete steps did you take to stop it from joining future Zoom meetings?

[USER]
we ensured that zoom meetings were invite only and that otter.ai was blocked by DNS/IP from our network ... the person that signed up to the service's account was deleted and any API integration was removed

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to past incidents with non-AI tools, how did handling this one feel different for you, if at all?

[USER]
it was fairly similar though with the speed that AI can perform actions it felt very urgent

[ASSISTANT]
When you sent out the company-wide message about what happened and the updated guidelines, how did people respond?

[USER]
they were in agreement as we laid out the facts clearly ... but a few employees questioned that it could be helpful to do in the future as minute takers could save employee time and effortr

[ASSISTANT]
Do you personally use any AI tools in your own workflow, like for troubleshooting, drafting comms, or documentation?

[USER]
No i feel that i would personally have to QA any AI output and therefore would be just as eashy to do it myself and keep up my sills in writing/typing/troubleshooting

[ASSISTANT]
Roughly how much time did that incident take, and what did it push aside from your usual work that day or week?

[USER]
2 hours perhaps and with a support role I can often shift jobs

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond the note taker, have there been other ways AI has shown up at your company that you’ve had to adapt policies or configurations for?

[USER]
integrated copilot for our dynamics 365 instance into various users outlook

[ASSISTANT]
For the Dynamics 365 Copilot in Outlook, what exactly did you set up or change, and what did users have to do on their end?

[USER]
we had to add the users to security groups so that the app was pushed out automatically ... then it was just a matter of showing each individual how to sign in to app and how they could track emails in our CRM and hpw to be careful with personal messages when doing so

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
certain types of employee think it is really going to change the way they work ... or rather how much they can slack off ... but I question if that is the right thing to think when dealing with our subject matter/ data

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific moment when a colleague talked about using it to take work off their plate, and what you said or did in that situation?

[USER]
wanting to automatically track emails into our CRM for one short client  email exchange... i felt/said that this could easily be manually input for one client email exchange and would only really be that much of a time saver when dealing with multiple client chains every day

[ASSISTANT]
How have your conversations with your head of IT changed because of these AI decisions and incidents?

[USER]
i'm sorry what do you mean by that can you rephrase?

[ASSISTANT]
Sure. When you and your head of IT discuss AI-related issues, how are those conversations different from your usual check-ins?

[USER]
thanks, i guess we are open to the idea so discuss how we can keep a handle on the very quickly evolving platforms and use case

[ASSISTANT]
When these topics come up with teammates outside IT, what stands out to you about how those conversations go?

[USER]
a lot of people tend to like to jump on to the newest trend without letting the dust settle ... whereas often as an IT professional we'd sit just behind the Beta and ensure through test devices that all of our day to day services required by all our employees still function when upgrading ... users don't seem to like this and just want new and shiny, without a care

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
individual remote support where it appears to be mainly user error and the user in question needs that personal touch to ensure they understand how to perform a task or fix a workflow

[ASSISTANT]
What makes that personal touch essential in those remote support cases?

[USER]
that certain demographics will prefer a call and face-to-face discussion to train in simple steps

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled those remote support calls instead of you, how do you think that would change your relationships with those users or your role on the team?

[USER]
that it would be-little my role and that they and I would have less human contact in our remote roles

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
ticket logging

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up ticket logging?

[USER]
just a bit of a chore that often gets forgotten as i just resolve the issue and then move on to the next but often my manager and director like to see how many issues i've been dealing with to ensure my workload is feasible

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled the ticket logging, would it change how your manager and director view your contribution, and in what way?

[USER]
no i think they'd deem it a good use case to ensure any little jobs that i performed would get logged/noted/closed automatically

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
that AI was here and its not going anywhere but that we need to be careful with how much personal data we let it run with especially in a SMB organisation

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from your company of how you put that caution into practice, step by step?

[USER]
keeping our azure instance locked down from integrations for users - only allowing admins to add an integration once researched and tested - pushed out only to a small working group before pushing out globally

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re deciding whether to approve or reject a new integration, what specific criteria do you look for before you say yes, and what tips would you pass on to a newcomer about making that call?

[USER]
country of origin, where the data is held, what sorts of data is being held, retention policy

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent integration you approved and what specific detail convinced you it met your bar?

[USER]
copilot and it was deemed fit for purpose because its a microsoft product

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered yet?

[USER]
nothing really

[ASSISTANT]

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I’m glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work as a software engineer whereby I design and develop applications and write codes, and cooperate with teams in enhancing technical systems. I design and develop applications and write codes, and cooperate with teams in enhancing technical systems.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job offers decent compensation definite goals respects opportunities to develop and has enough freedom to make significant decisions.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say definite goals, what does that look like to you in day‑to‑day work?

[USER]
For me definite goals mean knowing exactly what I am responsible for each day and what needs to be done to consider the work successful.

[ASSISTANT]
When you mention freedom to make significant decisions, what kinds of calls do you want to be able to make yourself?

[USER]
I want to decide how to approach my work choose tools and methods while I set priorities to solve problems without constant approval.

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about opportunities to develop, what kinds of growth or learning matter most to you?

[USER]
What matters most to me is learning new technical skills and also staying with current with technology.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI impacts my work by helping me write code faster solve problems more efficiently and automate routine tasks so I can focus on higher value work.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent time you used it on a specific task—what you were building, and how you used it step by step?

[USER]
The last feature I was writing was a small one and I applied AI to sketch the strategy to create a rough draft of the code debug a bug and improve the solution before I tested it and blended it.

[ASSISTANT]
In that feature you described, which parts did the AI actually produce, and which parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
AI generated boilerplate code and suggestions while I designed the logic reviewed everything tested it and made the final decisions.

[ASSISTANT]
Did the AI make any mistakes on that task?

[USER]
Yes it suggested a few incorrect assumptions and minor bugs that I had to catch and fix myself.

[ASSISTANT]
When you spotted those issues, what went through your mind?

[USER]
I thought that AI is a helpful tool but but I have to be careful when using it because it makes mistakes too.

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing the review and corrections feel to you in that moment?

[USER]
It felt satisfying because I was still in control of my project with fully relying on it.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that feature?

[USER]
I used the extra time to improve code quality add tests and help my colleague with their work.

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing that feature with AI compare to how you would have done it before you started using these tools?

[USER]
Compared to before the work was faster and less tedious but still required my expertise and decision making.

[ASSISTANT]
How do you decide when to bring AI into a task and when to leave it aside?

[USER]
I use AI in writing and solving regular issues but I put it aside when it requires more judgment context or responsibility.

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it on a task, how does it affect your confidence in the result?

[USER]
Using AI makes me confident provided that I comment on the work and base my decision on the work.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
On one hand, AI has helped me to enrich my working relationships; on the other hand, it has helped to avoid busywork and find more time to collaborate and discuss the issues more thoroughly.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific interaction where using AI led to a better conversation or collaboration with a teammate or manager? What happened?

[USER]
In one case AI helped me quickly prepare a clear draft and analysis which made it easier to explain my ideas to a teammate and led to a more productive discussion.

[ASSISTANT]
How did your teammate respond in that meeting—what did they say or do that showed the draft changed the conversation?

[USER]
My teammate said the draft made the idea much clearer and they were able to give focused feedback right away instead of asking basic questions.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I would never want to hand over final decision making responsibility

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping final decision making important for you personally?

[USER]
Keeping final decision making matters to me because it gives me ownership of my work and a sense of responsibility and pride in the results.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over final decisions, how do you think that would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
It would cause a decrease of trust undermine my feeling of responsibility and make my position less purposeful.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about the kinds of judgments you want to retain, which types feel non negotiable for you to keep?

[USER]
The non negotiable judgments for me are ethical choices technical tradeoffs prioritization and being accountable for the final outcome.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would gladly delegate AI repetitive tasks such as the writing of boilerplate codes to update documentation and do various routine fixes.

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to hand those repetitive tasks over—what makes them good candidates for an AI?

[USER]
They are predictable time consuming and low judgment tasks so letting AI handle them would free me to focus on higher value work.

[USER]
They are repetitive low risk tasks that take time without adding much value so AI is a good fit for handling them.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those tasks, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
I think others would see my contribution as more focused on problem solving and decision making rather than routine work.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them autonomy today means having control over your decisions learning how to use AI as a tool and still being responsible for the outcomes of your work.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your own work of what that looks like in practice?

[USER]
In my job it appears as utilizing AI to accelerate the processes of coding as I determine the strategy review the findings and make ownership of the ultimate product.

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might hear what you said: that it’s mainly about setting the direction up front, or that it’s mainly about owning the final call after reviewing inputs, including AI. Which of those is closer to what you mean, or is it something else altogether?

[USER]
It is closer to owning the final call because even if direction changes along the way the responsibility for the outcome stays with me.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
One thing I would like to add is that AI has made me more productive and made it more significant to be attentive and considerate of how I work.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. Is there anything else you’d like to add about AI’s impact on your work before we close?

[USER]
No, thank you!

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[USER]
4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for taking the time and sharing your experiences. Your insights were very clear and helpful for understanding how these tools are shaping your work. If anything else comes to mind later, feel free to share.

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a business analyst for a large bank

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
a job where you have some sort of control over your time, and one that you do not dread

[ASSISTANT]
When you say control over your time, what does that look like for you day to day?

[USER]
it means that I can mix work tasks in with personal tasks, and not have strict windows of time where i have to work vs where I have to do personal things

[ASSISTANT]
You also mentioned not dreading it. What makes a job something you look forward to rather than something you dread?

[USER]
if you enjoy the subject matter as well as the people you work with

[ASSISTANT]
Is there anything else you’d add as a core characteristic of a good job?

[USER]
good pay

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI is making a lot of things easier.  It is easier to research topics that I don't have knowledge of and helps me create and organize ideas

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used it to research or organize ideas at work? What was the task?

[USER]
I needed to assess the use of a particular document among several dozen teams.  So I created a survey and used CoPilot to organize and analyze the results

[ASSISTANT]
In that project, which parts did CoPilot handle, and which parts did you do yourself?

[USER]
I did the survey, CoPilot did the rest

[ASSISTANT]
What did CoPilot actually produce for you on that survey, and how did you check whether it got things right?

[USER]
it created statistical graphs and also pulled key insights based on the responses.  I read the responses myself to see if the key insights seemed to match the general sentiment on the results

[ASSISTANT]
Did CoPilot make any mistakes or miss anything important in that analysis, and if so, how did you handle it?

[USER]
copilot did not miss anything

[ASSISTANT]
When you first saw the graphs and key insights CoPilot generated, what went through your mind?

[USER]
I was impressed at how well CoPilot was able to present the data

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved by having CoPilot do the analysis and visuals?

[USER]
Ispent the extra time in meetings on various topics

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing that survey analysis with CoPilot compare to how you would have handled it before?

[USER]
it was a bit more thorough than I might have done, and it was wildly faster

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond that survey project, are there other parts of your day to day work where you use AI?

[USER]
yes if there are topics in meetings that I don't fully undersatnd, I will ask copilot to explain that topic to me in real time

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent meeting where you asked it to explain something in real time. What was the topic, and how did you use it in the moment?

[USER]
the topic was a proposition manager, I asked copilot to explain the specifics of that during the call so I could follow along

[ASSISTANT]
What did Copilot tell you about a proposition manager in that moment, and how did that shape what you said or asked during the call?

[USER]
copilot basically explained that it was a version of a user interface, of sorts. It helped me to visualize the conversation.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
it has not greatly affected them just yet, but it has started to make some communication more streamlined

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a recent instance where it streamlined communication, and what changed in the exchange?

[USER]
I had to summarize an issue based on a long email chain, and I asked copilot to do that for me.  It was very concise and I hardly had to make any adjustments

[ASSISTANT]
How did the person who received that summary respond, and did it change the back-and-forth that followed?

[USER]
they responded in-kind and were thankful for the support.  It did not change the back and forth necessarily

[ASSISTANT]
Has anything in how your manager or teammates rely on you shifted as you’ve started using these tools?

[USER]
nothing has shifted to that end yet

[ASSISTANT]
What conversations, if any, has your team had about when and how to use AI in your work?

[USER]
we have had a lot of conversations about how to use copilot for different topics such as resume writing, subject matter exploration, as well as tasking/emails/other productivity tasks

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
no, AI could take it all as long as I could remain employed

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you comfortable handing everything over as long as you stay employed? What matters most to you about keeping your role if the tools did the tasks?

[USER]
I trust that AI could complete the 'hard thinking' part of my job provided that I can guide it to do so.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over most of the tasks, how do you think that would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
I think it would make us faster in accomplishing many of our goals

[ASSISTANT]
If AI is doing most of the heavy lifting, what decisions or sign‑offs would you still want to keep yourself, if any?

[USER]
I would want to keep all current sign offs, because decisions still need human approval and acknowledgement

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
the document creation and all of the repetitive monotonous work

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up document creation and the repetitive work?

[USER]
I don't enjoy that kind of work.  it is time consuming and, often times, is a bit ambiguous

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those pieces, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
yes I could see some people thinking I am not pulling my weight under those circumstances

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
to me, it would mean that I have the freedom to complete my work on my own schedule, with respect to deadlines of course.  It also means that I have the freedom to complete my work at a place of my choosing unless there is a legitimate reason to select one location over another.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice from a recent week, so I can picture how you arranged your time and place to get something done?

[USER]
Yes -- one day last week I had an early morning doctor's appointment so I worked from my home office from 10am-7pm that day rather than a more usual 8-5 day

[ASSISTANT]
In getting a project done, how much say do you have in the priorities and the way you approach the work, and what does that look like in practice?

[USER]
I have a lot of say in how we complete the work, the priorities are more of a collaboration

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent project where you chose the approach—what options you considered, what you picked, and how you explained that choice to others?

[USER]
yes we had to find a way to move a customer from one offer to another, and I got a bit creative and worked with members of several teams to ensure that my theory was correct.  It turned out that this stop-gap process worked to keep customers satisified while working on a permanent solution.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t touched on?

[USER]
nothing in particular, we touched on a lot!

[ASSISTANT]

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an education manager in London

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
determination, being goal driven, always striving to do your best, and have an actual authentic passion for the job

[ASSISTANT]
When you say authentic passion, what does that look like in your day-to-day work?

[USER]
finding enjoyment in all the tasks that I do on a day-to-day basis even if I feel they getting repetitive I still have to find joy in them and find meaning and purpose like I'm actually contributing something to society through this job

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about being goal driven, how does that show up in how you plan or make decisions during a typical week?

[USER]
I always strive to set up goals at the beginning of the week and I also set targets to hit so I set my own personal targets outside of my work to make sure that I'm hitting the goals that I want to achieve by the end of the week, and then use personal planning methods in order to plan ahead and hit these daily goals

[ASSISTANT]
When you hit a setback or something takes longer than you expected, what does determination look like for you in that moment?

[USER]
I think the most important thing is not to let it set me back, and instead the following day to catch up on the work that I missed and make sure even at this very moment that anything that I've missed I am able to catch up on it the following day

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
on a day-to-day basis I use it for almost everything, and I find as time goes on I'm relying on it more and more for every day tasks and even when I come up with problems or issues I still find myself going back to it

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent task where you used it, step by step, from start to finish?

[USER]
I need to reword an email formally so I asked it to rephrase the email and I pretty much just copied and pasted the email

[ASSISTANT]
After it rephrased the email, what did you do next with the draft?

[USER]
I copied and pasted it into a plain text document said it didn't look like it's come out of Chachi PT and I may be changed a few minor elements of it and then I just sent it

[ASSISTANT]
When you read the AI version before sending, what stood out to you about the tone or wording?

[USER]
I have prompted my AI agent to specifically write things in a certain manner said it doesn't look like AI for example I won't use it – I won't use certain things that might look like AI in an email so the email is that it comes out for me I always like absolutely perfect like I barely have to change anything usually

[ASSISTANT]
Has it ever produced something in an email that didn’t fit what you wanted or missed the mark? If so, what did you do in that moment?

[USER]
if I'm not happy with what it has generated or ask it to generate it five different times and then I'll pick out the best elements in each of the emails and put it together to make my own email

[ASSISTANT]
Besides emails, what’s another task you’ve used it for recently?

[USER]
I asked if a general advice with solving a problem at work

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about that problem—what was going on, and what you asked it for exactly?

[USER]
I was falling behind with certain work tasks and I wasn't sure whether it was worth catching up on the tasks at all and I wanted to highlight like the pros and cons of catching up on the task versus just leaving it

[ASSISTANT]
What did it suggest you do, and what did you end up deciding?

[USER]
it's suggested that I make some small steps in order to do as much as I could with the time that I had

[ASSISTANT]
When you started taking those small steps, what went through your mind as you put them into practice?

[USER]
I thought the advice that I was given was very good because it was a good in between

[ASSISTANT]
What was your gut response to leaning on it for that kind of judgment about what to tackle first?

[USER]
I feel it's a very productive method of solving problems I think everybody should do it and I highly recommend it

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
it's much better than humans, if I ask human for advice they will give me the wrong advice most of the time I would say AI is much better at giving me advice

[ASSISTANT]
Can you share a recent moment when you chose to ask AI instead of a colleague, and what happened afterward?

[USER]
that isn't just a recent moment it's literally every single moment of my life since it came about I always use it instead of using humans for advice it gives me much better advice it gives me more balanced advice

[ASSISTANT]
You’re using it every moment, as you said. What has that changed in how you interact day to day with your team?

[USER]
I will just tell them whatAI PT is already told me

[ASSISTANT]
How do your colleagues or your manager usually respond when you say you’re acting on what it suggested?

[USER]
they don't usually care

[ASSISTANT]
Has this changed how often you ask your manager or clients for input?

[USER]
Think everybody uses it so I don't think it's a big deal

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
probably anything that involves personal information or documents that I don't feel comfortable sharing

[ASSISTANT]
What makes it important for you to keep those kinds of tasks in your own hands?

[USER]
also I can think anything to do with money or finances but for example telling exactly how much money I have and where my money is hold

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about letting an AI handle those sensitive documents, what concerns come up for you?

[USER]
mostly because of security risks the fact that your account get hacked or anything like that

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI did handle those sensitive tasks anyway, how do you think that would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
I don't think it would change much to be honest I think maybe they would trust me less if they knew that I was feeding sensitive documents into an AI agent

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
practically everything else

[ASSISTANT]
Can you name one specific part you’d hand over first, and why that one?

[USER]
probably answering emails and reading emails

[ASSISTANT]
What makes answering and reading emails the first thing you’d hand over?

[USER]
because I think AI is very good at that already so I already trusted to take over absolutely everything my email box

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled your inbox, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
I don't think so, I think it will get to the point where I can answer my emails as though it's me like nobody will be able to tell the difference eventually

[ASSISTANT]
We've talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
honestly, this is one of the hardest questions you've asked me, I have no idea how to answer it, 10 years ago I would've said control and creativity but I feel that AI has taken over both of those completely, I don't think there's gonna be anything left for humans eventually

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific moment when you felt that shift you mentioned, where control or creativity felt like it had moved away from you? What happened in that instance?

[USER]
I would say in the last year with the AI agents I think it's been a gradual change over time that I've noticed it obviously with the early AI agents maybe two years ago I could see a lot of flaws but I think it's getting better and better and it's progressing at such a speed that I feel it will overtake humans very quickly

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you let an AI take the first pass on something creative or strategic for work, and how your role shifted in that task?

[USER]
I asked it to help me write a caption for a PowerPoint presentation image and I asked it to write 10 funny captions and it came up with 10 brilliant captions that are better than anything I could've ever come up with in 1 million years

[ASSISTANT]
In that captions example, what parts were still in your hands—what decisions did you make before sending it out, and how did that shape the final result?

[USER]
level of creativity and humour that used was much better than any human and was definitely much better than anything I could've come up without my own creative mind, and I consider myself a very creative person, so to face an AI that's even more creative than me is extremely unnerving

[ASSISTANT]
If you had to give that young person one practical test for whether they have enough say in their job today, what would that test be?

[USER]
whether they feel valued and whether they are getting paid significantly higher than the average wage in the UK or whatever country they're in

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what feeling valued looks like in your day-to-day work?

[USER]
feeling like your views and opinions are being listened to and taken on board and people are open to your suggestions and encouraging you to make suggestions as well

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything we haven’t covered about how AI is changing your work that you want to add?

[USER]
just that I feel that there isn't going to be long before we're going to need a universal basic income or this is going to turn into a terrible situation where practically everybody is out of work, nobody wants to have kids on if you can afford her kids and it's just gonna turn into a really terrible situation I think it's already going on in that direction particularly in the UK

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing that. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work, or does this cover the main points for you?

[USER]
just that I feel well I've had a quote recently that said that they wanted AI to take over doing the dishes so that they can make art they didn't want AI to make art so that they had to do the dishes, in other words I think most people were expecting that the robot uprising would be taken over the physical manual labour and the boring jobs that humans don't want to do but instead AI has just created a way to replace creativity which is one of the few things that most humans enjoy (at least me)

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for putting that so clearly. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work, or does this cover it for you?

[USER]
I think that covers it unless you have any other questions for me to answer

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an IT manager

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job should be a job that satisfies it workers

[ASSISTANT]
When you say it satisfies its workers, what does that look like to you in practice?

[USER]
a work that concerns about the intrest of it enployers

[ASSISTANT]
Could you give me an example of a time when a job really took your interests into account? What happened?

[USER]
I have no personal expierence yet

[ASSISTANT]
What would make you feel satisfied at work in a typical week?

[USER]
when the work provide some basic trainings to help develop a better career path

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI helps in so many ways at my work, which is very positive

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent task where you used AI at work, and walk me through what you did step by step?

[USER]
The task was about troubleshooting a major server outage in an IT department.  Alright, here's a simple sentence summary of each step:
1.  Issue Identification: Users couldn't access the main server, indicating a problem.
2.  Initial Assessment (Without AI): Checked basic things, but no obvious problems were found.
3.  AI Tool Integration: Used an AI tool that works with our monitoring systems.
4.  Data Input: Gave the AI error logs, network data, and system info.
5.  AI Analysis: The AI looked for patterns and potential causes in the data.
6.  AI-Generated Hypothesis: The AI suggested a database update was causing a conflict.
7.  Verification (With AI Guidance): The AI gave steps to check the database logs and configuration.
8.  Action and Resolution: We rolled back the update, and the server was working again.
9.  Post-Incident Analysis: The AI summarized the problem and gave suggestions for the future.

[ASSISTANT]
In that outage example, which parts did the AI handle and which parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
Initial Assessment was the part I handled myself

[ASSISTANT]
After the AI suggested the database conflict, what did you do next, and what did the AI do at that stage?

[USER]
Used an AI tool that works with our monitoring systems.

[ASSISTANT]
What were the exact checks you carried out to verify the conflict the AI pointed to?

[USER]
We rolled back the update, and the server was working again.

[USER]
We rolled back the update, and the server was working again

[ASSISTANT]
Before deciding to roll back, what did you look at to confirm the cause?

[USER]
check the database logs and configuration.

[ASSISTANT]
When the AI pointed to the database update as the likely cause, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
nothing really

[ASSISTANT]
When you reviewed the AI’s guidance and the logs, how sure did you feel about proceeding with the rollback, and why?

[USER]
I was not very sure but I gave a try

[USER]
I was not very sure but I gave a try

[ASSISTANT]
Did the AI get anything wrong or miss anything during that outage, or was it spot on the whole way?

[USER]
There was nothing missed by the Ai

[ASSISTANT]
When the server came back up after the rollback, what stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
I was impressed

[ASSISTANT]
When you solved it faster with AI, what did you do with the time you saved that day?

[USER]
Attended to other work matters

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
very good and positive

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific interaction with a colleague or a manager that changed because of AI? What happened?

[USER]
I have not expierenced anything of such yet

[ASSISTANT]
Even if there hasn’t been a big change, has using AI shifted how you communicate updates during incidents with your team or managers?

[USER]
no

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
not sure

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about your day-to-day, is there a part of your role that you’d want to keep in your own hands during a crisis, rather than letting an AI take over? Why that part?

[USER]
I would say attended meetings, which is not possible for Ai to do that on my behalf

[ASSISTANT]
What makes being in the meeting yourself essential, compared to having an AI listen in and provide summaries?

[USER]
nothing much, I just do not think Ai should do that

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily hand over to an AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I can not tell for now

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
decision making

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of a recent decision you made at work and how you went about making it?

[USER]
played a role in hiring

[ASSISTANT]
What exactly did you decide in that hiring process, and what steps did you take to reach that decision?

[USER]
I contributed in interviews

[USER]
and analying job applicants

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through one applicant where your input changed the outcome, from first screening to the final decision?

[USER]
Skills and Experience: Assessing candidates' qualifications against job requirements.
Cultural Fit: Determining alignment between candidates' values and company culture. Problem-Solving Abilities: Evaluating candidates' approach to handling challenges.
Communication Skills: Assessing candidates' ability to convey ideas.
Motivation and Enthusiasm: Gauging candidates' interest in the role and company.

[ASSISTANT]
Could you tell me about one specific candidate where your view was different from others on the panel, and what happened because of your input?

[USER]
Summarizing: Condensing information to its main points.
Synthesizing: Combining different ideas into a new whole.
Analyzing: Breaking down complex information to understand it better.
Evaluating: Judging the value or quality of something.
Inferring: Drawing conclusions based on evidence.

[USER]
.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking back to that hiring round, can you describe one candidate where you argued for or against them and what the final decision was?

[USER]
none

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for your time today. Is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
NA

[ASSISTANT]

Duration: 65.75 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am the Executive Director of a small software startup that creates AI enhanced B2B software for businesses

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job provides meaningful work, autonomy, and clear opportunities for growth. It offers stability and fair compensation, but also challenges people to improve their skills. Strong communication, supportive leadership, and the ability to make an impact all play a major role in whether a job feels fulfilling and sustainable.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say meaningful work, what does that look like for you in the day to day?

[USER]
Meaningful work for me is solving real problems for businesses and seeing our products make someone’s workflow faster and more efficient. It is knowing that what I build is actually used and valued. I also find meaning in guiding my team, making strategic decisions, and watching ideas turn into features that help people.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about growth, what lets you know a role genuinely offers it?

[USER]
I know a role offers real growth when I can see a clear path to learning new skills, taking on bigger responsibilities, and making decisions that matter. Growth also shows up when the work pushes me to think in new ways and when my contributions directly shape the direction of the team or the product.

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned strong communication and supportive leadership. When that’s really working, what does it look like in practice?

[USER]
When communication and leadership are really working, everyone knows what the goals are and what their part is. People share updates openly, ask questions without hesitation, and get honest feedback that helps them improve. Leadership feels present and supportive. They remove obstacles, guide decisions, and listen to concerns. The team understands the expectations, feels appreciated, and works together smoothly because nothing is unclear or confusing.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI has become central to my work. It speeds up research, planning, and problem solving, and it helps me handle large amounts of information quickly. It also supports our team by improving our software products and giving us tools that make development faster and more accurate. Because of AI, I can focus more on strategy and leadership instead of getting buried in routine tasks.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used AI on a specific work task, step by step?

[USER]
The last time I used AI was earlier today while preparing a feature outline for one of our software products. First, I described the problem we wanted to solve and the goals for the feature. Then I asked the AI to generate possible design approaches. After that, I refined the ideas with follow up prompts until I had a clear structure. I used the final output to guide my team and speed up the planning process.

[ASSISTANT]
In that feature outline example, which parts did the AI produce and which parts did you create or rewrite yourself?

[USER]
The AI produced the initial structure, the list of possible design approaches, and a few sample workflows. I created the original problem description, clarified the goals, and rewrote most of the final outline in my own words. I kept the parts that were useful, reorganized the flow, and adjusted the tone so it matched how my team actually works.

[ASSISTANT]
Did the AI make any mistakes or suggest anything off in that outline, and if so, how did you handle it?

[USER]
Yes, it did. It sometimes added features that were outside the scope or too complex for the first release. It also made a few assumptions about our user flow that were not accurate. When that happened, I removed what did not fit, corrected the details, and guided it with more context. I treat its output as a draft, not a final answer, so I edit it until it lines up with the real needs of the product.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were revising the AI’s outline, what was your gut response in the moment?

[USER]
My gut response was calm and matter of fact. I have learned to expect that AI will miss pieces or overreach, so it did not frustrate me. I just thought Okay, here is a good starting point, now let me shape it into what it actually needs to be. It felt similar to editing a junior teammate’s draft, useful, but still needing guidance and correction.

[ASSISTANT]
When you do this kind of planning with AI compared to before, what changes for you in the workflow or the pace of getting to a solid draft?

[USER]
Using AI changes both the workflow and the pace in a noticeable way. Before AI, getting to a solid draft took longer because I had to build everything from zero. Now I can move faster because I start with something rather than nothing. That shift saves time and mental energy. It also lets me focus more on strategy and clarity instead of spending the first hour staring at a blank page.

[ASSISTANT]
When you save that first hour, what do you usually do with the time and headspace you get back?

[USER]
I usually use that extra time and headspace to think more deeply about the product itself. Instead of grinding through early drafting, I can refine goals, test assumptions, or map out edge cases. Sometimes I review related systems or talk with my team to confirm details. It gives me room to be more thoughtful and make better decisions rather than rushing through the basics.

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond feature planning, can you tell me about another recent situation where you used AI at work and what happened?

[USER]
A recent example was drafting a proposal for a new client integration. I gave the AI the technical context, timeline, and pain points, and it produced a basic draft with sections like scope and deliverables. The structure was helpful, but the wording was too generic, so I rewrote the whole thing to match our tone and added the real technical details. The AI mainly saved me from starting with a blank page, while the final proposal was shaped by my edits.

[ASSISTANT]
What is it like for you when you’re reviewing or correcting the drafts it produces?

[USER]
When I review or correct AI drafts, it feels smooth and efficient. I scan for gaps or weak points, tighten the language, and add the depth the model cannot provide. It is more like polishing a rough template than fixing real errors, and it lets me stay focused on clarity and strategy instead of getting stuck on the first version.

[ASSISTANT]
Has using AI ever led you to change a decision you were going to make, and what happened as a result?

[USER]
Yes, a few times AI has pushed me to rethink a decision. Sometimes it lays out risks or alternative angles I had not fully considered, and seeing those options clearly presented makes me slow down and reassess. When that happens, I usually compare its reasoning with my own instincts, check the facts, and then choose the stronger path. In most cases the change leads to cleaner plans or avoids unnecessary work, so the end result is usually more efficient and better thought out.

[ASSISTANT]
Is there any kind of task where you choose not to use AI, and what leads you to draw that line?

[USER]
Yes. I avoid using AI for tasks that require personal judgment, sensitive communication, or decisions that depend on context only I can see. Things like team feedback, investor updates, or anything involving subtle relationship dynamics feel wrong to delegate because tone and intent matter too much. I also skip AI when the task is so core to my role that outsourcing any part of it would weaken my understanding. The line is basically this, if relying on AI would dilute my judgment, affect trust, or distance me from something I need to stay deeply connected to, I do it myself.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
AI has mainly improved my working relationships by helping to free up time for better communication. Since I can prepare drafts, summaries, or plans faster, I show up to conversations more organized, which helps everyone move forward with less stress. It also lowers the pressure on my team because I am not handing off rushed or unclear tasks. At the same time, I am careful not to let AI replace real collaboration. I still make space for human input so people feel heard and valued. Overall it has helped us work smoother, but I stay mindful to keep the relationships personal and not overly automated.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent meeting or interaction where something created with AI shaped the discussion between you and your team? What happened in that exchange?

[USER]
Yes, surely, I recently brought an AI generated draft into a planning meeting, and it changed the whole conversation. Instead of spending time defining the basics, everyone reacted to the draft right away. The team pointed out what worked, what needed fixing, and what did not fit our product. It gave us a clear starting point and made the discussion faster and more focused. By the end, the final plan was better than the AI version, but the AI helped us get there quickly.

[USER]
you there?

[ASSISTANT]
I’m here. When you share something that started with AI, how do your teammates tend to respond, and what stands out to you about those reactions?

[USER]
They usually respond with curiosity and focus. They treat the AI draft like a rough starting point, not a finished answer. What stands out is how quickly it gets them talking. Instead of debating from scratch, they react to something concrete, which helps them clarify their own ideas. Sometimes they’re impressed by how clean the structure is, and other times they immediately point out what feels off or unrealistic. Either way, it speeds up the conversation and gets everyone aligned to collaborate faster.

[ASSISTANT]
How, if at all, has using AI changed your relationships with clients or investors?

[USER]
It has mostly improved those relationships. AI lets me produce polished work faster, so I respond to clients and investors with better plans and precise timelines. It also helps me show multiple strategic options quickly, which makes me look more prepared and thoughtful. The only real change is that I’m careful not to rely on AI when communicating sensitive ideas, because trust comes from my own judgment. Overall, it has made me more reliable and more confident in those interactions.

[ASSISTANT]
Has using AI ever created any tension or misunderstanding with someone you work with, and what happened in that situation?

[USER]
Yes, a couple of times. One memorable time was when someone assumed an AI generated draft reflected a final decision. Also, I once shared an early outline with a teammate, and they reacted as if I had already committed to the plan. I had to explain that it was only a starting point to spark discussion. Moments like that taught me to label AI drafts clearly and set expectations upfront. After that, the tension went away, and collaboration actually improved.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I would never hand over the human parts of leadership. Even if an AI could do it perfectly, I would not give up personally mentoring my team, building trust, establishing collaborative culture, or making decisions that depend on judgment, values, and intuition. Those moments of connection and responsibility define what leadership means to me, and they shape the direction of the company in a way an AI cannot replicate.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent moment of mentoring or a hard call you made where being the one in the room mattered, and what made it important that it was you?

[USER]
I recently had a teammate who was unsure about the direction of a feature and worried they were falling behind. I sat with them, talked through the decisions, and helped them focus on what really mattered instead of letting them feel overwhelmed. Being there in person mattered because I could read their stress, reassure them, and help them rebuild confidence in a way no AI could. The conversation was not just about the work, it was about supporting them as a person.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is it important to you to keep those leadership moments yourself rather than handing any part of them to an AI?

[USER]
It matters to me because real leadership is built on trust, empathy, and human judgment, and I feel like those things cannot be simply be delegated (to AI). When someone on my team is struggling or needs direction, they are not just looking for information, they are looking for understanding, accountability, and a sense that someone (human) genuinely cares about their growth. An AI can offer guidance, but it cannot form a relationship or take responsibility for the outcome. Keeping those moments genuine and intimate protects the culture I want to build and reminds my team that they matter as people.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Honestly, I would hand off all the repetitive operational work tomorrow without hesitation. Things like drafting routine emails, pulling status summaries, organizing meeting notes, formatting documents, or preparing early versions of reports all drain time without adding much creative or strategic value. AI could handle those tasks quickly and consistently, which would free time to stay focused on leadership, vision, and the decisions that actually move the company forward.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those operational pieces, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
I do not think it would change how others see my contribution. When AI handles the routine pieces, my value shows up in the strategic work, the decisions, the judgment, and the leadership that only I can provide. People would see me spending more time on direction, mentoring, problem solving, and shaping the product rather than being buried in busywork. It would highlight the parts of my role that actually define my contribution rather than dilute them.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them autonomy means having real control over how you approach your work. It means being trusted to decide how to solve problems, manage your time, and shape your contributions without someone dictating every step. Autonomy today also means knowing how to use tools like AI to amplify your strengths while staying accountable for the final result. It is the freedom to think independently paired with the responsibility to deliver.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from your work where you exercised that kind of freedom paired with responsibility, and what you did step by step?

[USER]
A recent example was deciding whether to move forward with a new feature. I sketched the concept, used AI to brainstorm options, kept the parts that matched our goals, and rewrote everything else. Then I checked technical feasibility with my lead engineer, laid out the risks, and drafted a short proposal with AI helping only with structure. I made the final decision by weighing what the business really needed against the actual work it would take to produce it. The autonomy was choosing how to navigate the decision, and the responsibility was owning whatever results came from it.

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about autonomy there, do you mean mostly choosing the methods and pace to hit a given target, or do you mean setting the targets and priorities themselves? Which is closer to what you have in mind?

[USER]
I mean setting the targets and priorities themselves. Choosing the methods and pace matters too, but the deeper level of autonomy for me is deciding what is actually worth pursuing in the first place. That’s where the real responsibility shows up.

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re deciding what is actually worth pursuing, what signals tell you it’s time to set a new target, and how, if at all, does AI influence that call?

[USER]
I usually realize it’s time for a new target when customer needs a new feature, a strong opportunity shows up, or our current plan stops giving the results we want. AI doesn’t decide for me, but it helps me notice trends sooner and test my ideas before I move forward.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything we haven’t covered about how AI is changing your work that you’d like to add?

[USER]
hello?

[ASSISTANT]
I’m here. Before we wrap up, is there anything we haven’t covered about how AI is changing your work that you’d like to add?

[USER]
AI has mainly changed the pace of my work. I move from idea to execution much faster, and I waste less time on early drafts or repetitive tasks. It has not replaced the judgment or leadership parts of my job, but it has made the strategic parts clearer because I’m not buried in busywork. Overall, it feels like having a really fast assistant that lets me focus on the decisions that actually matter.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. Is there anything else you’d like to add about AI’s impact on your work?

[USER]
One last thing I’d add is that AI has made my work feel lighter. It takes pressure off the small stuff so I can stay focused on the bigger picture. It has not changed my role, but it has changed the way I spend my energy, and that shift has made me a better leader.

[ASSISTANT]
Have we covered everything important from your perspective, or is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
I think we’ve covered the main points. The only thing I’d add is that AI has become a steady part of my workflow. It does not replace my judgment, but it frees up enough mental space that I can lead with more clarity and focus. That shift has made a real difference in how I work day to day, and I see myself as much more effective and productive.

[USER]

Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
i am jerry and work as an IT manager

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
i would say hardwork and dedication

[ASSISTANT]
When you say hard work and dedication, what does that look like for you day to day?

[USER]
it means showing up every work day and doing the tasks required

[ASSISTANT]
Besides effort, what else matters to you in a job for it to feel like a good one?

[USER]
a good pay and respect for humanity

[ASSISTANT]
When you say respect for humanity, what does that look like in your workplace?

[USER]
it means treating employees with respect

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI makes my work easier. i use AI to brainstorm and edit work documents

[USER]
AI makes my work easier. i use AI to brainstorm and edit work documents

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it to work on a document—what was the document, and what did you ask the AI to do?

[USER]
i used AI earlier today to edit an email to make it formal

[ASSISTANT]
In that email case, what did you give the AI to start with, and what changes did it make that you decided to keep?

[USER]
i gave AI the content i had written down

[ASSISTANT]
What specific edits did it suggest that you decided to keep? For example, were they wording changes, tone adjustments, structure, or something else?

[USER]
it was a combination of wording changes and structure

[ASSISTANT]
When you saw those edits, what went through your mind?

[USER]
i thought about how to input them into the final email

[ASSISTANT]
Did it suggest anything you decided not to use or that you had to change back? If so, what didn’t sit right and how did you handle it?

[USER]
no, that did not happen

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent time you used it to brainstorm—what were you trying to come up with, and how did you work with the AI step by step?

[USER]
last week i used AI to brainstorm how to trouble network issue at the workplace. i explained the situation into the AI and i got valuable response

[ASSISTANT]
In that network troubleshooting case, what steps did it suggest, and which ones did you actually try?

[USER]
it suggested a couple steps and asked that i try them one after the other to see what works

[ASSISTANT]
In that troubleshooting exchange, did any of the suggestions turn out to be off the mark or not useful, and how did you react when you noticed that?

[USER]
no. i think they were all useful and relevant

[ASSISTANT]
When you use AI on a task like that, what emotions come up for you, if any?

[USER]
joy. i feel good after getting the solution

[ASSISTANT]
When you save time by using it like that, what do you end up doing with that time?

[USER]
i use the time to complete other tasks

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
AI has not really affected my working relationships

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
the only aspects of my job that i wont give to AI are the one that involve physical contact

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about the in‑person parts that you want to keep?

[USER]
AI cannot handle them

[ASSISTANT]
What matters to you about being there in person—what do you do or pick up on in those moments that you wouldn’t want to hand over?

[USER]
some of those projects include dismantling devices and all

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI or robot did those hands‑on tasks, how do you think it would change your role on the team or how your teammates rely on you?

[USER]
i dont think AI or robot would handle those tasks. but if it happens, i think my teammates would find me less valuable

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
writing emails and setting reminders

[USER]
riting emails and setting reminders

[USER]
writing emails and setting reminders

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to hand off writing emails and setting reminders?

[USER]
because AI would easily handle that for me

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled your emails and reminders, would it change how others see your contribution to the team in any way?

[USER]
no, i dont think so

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
i would tell  them it means doing the job you love when you want. it means making decisions for yourself and the workplace.

[USER]
i would tell them it means doing the job you love when you want. it means making decisions for yourself and the workplace.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your own work of what that looks like in practice? For instance, a recent moment when you chose how and when to do something and made a call that shaped the workplace.

[USER]
like today when i made and sent that email, i did it on my own without the input or supervision of another person

[ASSISTANT]
When you say making decisions for the workplace, what kinds of decisions are squarely yours to make in your role?

[USER]
decisions like budget allocation and maintenance

[USER]
decisions like budget allocation and maintenance

[ASSISTANT]
Could you walk me through a recent budget allocation or maintenance decision you made, what options you weighed, and what you decided in the end?

[USER]
i weighed what we needed and what we had at that time. for maintenance, we normally do it at scheduled times except when there is an emergency

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI has changed your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
no for now

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I primarily handle dev ops for  application deployment and maintenance.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Stable employment, as well as room for growth in the field.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say stable employment, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
I feel in the day to day I should feel a clear sense that my job values me and won't lay off at the first sign of trouble.  The mental benefit of feeling secure helps me work better and harder.

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about room for growth, what does that mean in practice for you?

[USER]
Room for growth is allowing me to either move upwards, or pursue the means to increase what I earn in other meaningful and challenging ways.

[ASSISTANT]
Between stability and growth, which carries more weight for you when you’re evaluating a job?

[USER]
If I'm looking to only consider one factor, stability would be the most important.  Growth in a short-lived job would have very little value.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI has definitely become a threat to people in my positions due to managerial staff not actually understanding what it is capable of.  It is constantly over-valued and over-estimated and being forced to use it tends to create more problems than it solves.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent time you were asked to use it on a specific task in your deployment or maintenance work? What was the task?

[USER]
In maintenance they were specifically asking for alerts and other routine tasks to be completely automated.  Given the clients we work with, the decisions it could make had nowhere near the level of flexibility required.  This is also adding to the fact, no one wants to code something that will invalidate their job.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example of automating alerts, what did you try to have the system do, and what did you keep under human control?

[USER]
I never pursued this and refused to implement it, due to it threatening my job position.  If I had to answer I would have specifically had it handle emergency alerts and potential solutions to resolve them without human interaction.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were asked to automate alerts like that, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
That they wanted to replace my job duties with an automated AI process.

[ASSISTANT]
How did you communicate your refusal to your manager, and what happened after that conversation?

[USER]
I was professional and framed it as a lack of knowledge on my part.  Following this, I simply provided alternate solutions that did not involve AI.  Such as, consolidating alerts to more user-friendly reference points to increase efficiency.

[ASSISTANT]
What changed in the day to day after you rolled out the consolidated, more user‑friendly alerts?

[USER]
This was not something that was immediately implemented.  It was simply brought up as a potential avenue to pursue.

[ASSISTANT]
Aside from the alerts request, has AI shown up in your deployment or maintenance work in any other concrete way?

[USER]
for deployment specifically, I have heard that there might be attempts to use AI to automate newer client packages.  However, as far as I'm aware this has not been implemented yet.

[ASSISTANT]
Have you used any AI tools yourself in your workflow so far? If so, what did you try them on?

[USER]
I have not used them extensively, but I have used services like ChatGPT to write rudimentary scripts to automate tedious entry tasks or other similar duties.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking of the last script you had it draft for a tedious entry task, what was the script meant to do?

[USER]
There is a lot of rote data entry involved with the amount of clients we have.  I would usually have a script that would run and copy data from our client database to fill in orders or alerts to minimize the time spent typing the information.

[ASSISTANT]
After it drafted the script, what changes did you make before you felt okay running it on your systems?

[USER]
In general it was very accurate, I edited it for formatting at first.  I also made sure to carefully proofread the work after it was done to ensure there were no errors.  There never were any critical errors that popped up.

[ASSISTANT]
When you ran that script the first few times, what was your gut response—more at ease because it sped things up, or more on edge watching for mistakes?

[USER]
In the beginning I was mostly on edge ensuring it didn't make entry errors.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved once the script was working reliably?

[USER]
I spent a lot more time on more complex tasks or making myself available in the event a critical alert came up.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
In general I feel it has solidified me with people on the same level, and made my relationships towards upper management more critical.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent interaction with a peer where you felt that sense of solidarity—what happened and what stands out to you about it?

[USER]
This is almost entirely on us all having pretty firm agreements that coding AI that automates our jobs will destroy our careers.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a specific conversation with a manager about using AI—what you said, what they said, and how it ended?

[USER]
A lot of the conversations deal with management having idealistic views of AI, assuming they can use it to solve nearly any problem.  Most of my discussions involve explaining what it is actually capable of.  In general, I feel the words are said, but not really taking to heart.  It is common to get the feeling that I simply dont have the experience to utilize it in the way they want.

[ASSISTANT]
Has this push from management changed how your contributions are recognized or evaluated at work?

[USER]
I do feel that talk of AI is at the forefront.  Due to this, if you aren't bringing it up or trying to fofer suggestions with it, you are definitely less recognized.

[ASSISTANT]
When a teammate suggests using AI on a task, how do you usually handle that conversation?

[USER]
I would caution against it, or advise implementing it in a way that makes it a very minor part of the process.

[ASSISTANT]
Has talk of using these tools changed your conversations with clients about reliability or SLAs?

[USER]
While I am not directly involved in client conversations, from what I have heard from co-workers it has created an expectation for quicker response times.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Assuming such a perfect AI existed, I wouldn't want to hand over maintenance of most systems or applications.  I feel that while humans can make errors, our judgement is what lets us make less optimal decisions that sometimes benefit the user more.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you share a concrete incident where you chose a technically suboptimal path because it was better for the user? What happened and what stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
Multiple examples have happened in the past, such as slower delivery to ensure the full operability of the software is available. Sometimes its better to make the customer slightly displeased in the present to allow them to have the best experience possible at a later date.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled that maintenance work instead of you, how do you think it would change your role on the team?

[USER]
A huge portion of my job would functionally disappear, I would assume that this would mean I would be laid off or have my work responsibilities (and pay) cut accordingly.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping that maintenance work in human hands important to you personally?

[USER]
While I do have some bias, as I would like to keep my job, I do feel that humans are simply more reliable and personal touch is important.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Almost any and all rote data entry that I have to do.

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up the rote data entry?

[USER]
It requires a significant amount of typing, and doesn't involve any stimulating problems or challenges.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over the data entry, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
I don't feel it would.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Autonomy to me is the ability to produce and implement your own solutions to problems that you will face in the field.  The opportunities where you challenge yourself are the ways you will grow, and lacking the ability to do this will keep you stagnate.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a recent example where you produced and implemented your own solution—what was the problem and what did you do?

[USER]
While I can't be too specific due to the nature of my work, I feel I have a decent broad example.  I received a fairly critical alert, and it caused a massive downtime for the client it concerned.  I was at the forefront of solving this and managed to troubleshoot and fix the underlying code causing it.  This also improved the process itself to ensure that specific problem didnt happen again.

[ASSISTANT]
In that incident, which parts were you able to decide and act on yourself, and where did you need someone’s approval before moving ahead?

[USER]
Anything touching client data I had to have approval before dealing with.

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might hear what you said. One is that it’s mainly about choosing your own methods and tools. The other is that it’s about choosing which problems to work on in the first place. Which is closer to what you mean, or is it something else?

[USER]
Choosing your own methods and tools is specifically what I mean

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
Nothing to add.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers!

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an IT person

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Focus, Determination, skill, commitment and consistency

[ASSISTANT]
When you think of focus in a good job, what does that look like in your day to day?

[USER]
Focus mean, exploring the Job and doing researching to stay relevant and be consistent

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent moment at work when determination really showed up for you? What happened and what did you do?

[USER]
I was given a chance by my supervisor to handle a project with a new team, it was difficult to start, The team and I aren't familiar which slow down the project, and I was determined to accomplish the goal

[ASSISTANT]
When you mention consistency, what does that look like for you over a week or a month?

[USER]
I was consistent with my Job, I make research on how to be consistent with supervising, hiring and managing

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI, have been helpful, in terms of correction, brainstorming, drafting of project, analysis

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific recent project where you used AI? What was the task, and how did you use it step by step?

[USER]
The project I did with the new team, the AI helps on how to navigate with the team the AI also help on correcting the words are regenerating the ideas

[ASSISTANT]
In that project, what parts did you do yourself, and what parts did the AI handle?

[USER]
I write out the ideas and the AI helps in regenerating the words, correct spelling, correct punctuation and coma

[ASSISTANT]
Did the AI make any mistakes on that project, and if so, what did you notice and how did you handle it?

[USER]
No, the AI did not make any mistakes on the project, but rather protect.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were reviewing its suggestions, what went through your mind as you decided what to keep or change?

[USER]
That the AI have being helpful

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing this kind of drafting and revising with AI compare to how you handled it before you started using AI?

[USER]
Using the AI boost the level of my confidence, unlike when I'm not using it

[ASSISTANT]
When you say it boosted your confidence, what stands out to you about how that shift happened for you during the project?

[USER]
My project was error free and well organize

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with any time you saved by using AI on that project?

[USER]
I keep learning more on how to explore with AI

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It only affected my work positively

[ASSISTANT]
Can you share a specific interaction with a colleague or your supervisor where using AI changed how you worked together? What happened?

[USER]
The AI help on how to interact with my supervisor, I also share with my colleague on how useful AI can be.

[ASSISTANT]
When you brought those AI-supported ideas or drafts to your supervisor, how did they respond, and what happened next in that interaction?

[USER]
My supervisor was convinced and Amazed how useful AI can be, and he also promises to communicate with others.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
None, I don't think there is any job AI can not do

[ASSISTANT]
What leads you to feel comfortable handing over any part of your role to AI?

[USER]
Have make use AI and have seen how helpful and interesting it is

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over most of your tasks, how do you think your role on the team would change?

[USER]
My role on the team won't change, ideas will still be shared, working together, managing and hiring and supervising the team won't change

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled most of the execution work, what would you personally spend more time on in your day?

[USER]
Ensuring everything is accordingly, checking if the team are following the instruction accordingly.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Reviewing of CV, generating ideas and drafting out ideas

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to hand over reviewing CVs or drafting ideas to AI? What makes those good candidates in your eyes?

[USER]
Because I believe, AI won't make choice base on merit, discrimination of gender or racism. Everything will be based on qualification.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I think has a young person, the best is to learn rather than be after of taking decision and have their control.  Learning is important.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice for someone in their first year on the job?

[USER]
Having the ability to manage a team, supervisor, and hiring, with few errors

[ASSISTANT]
When you say manage a team in that first year, what kinds of decisions would they make on their own, and what would they check with a supervisor before moving ahead?

[USER]
Being able to generate ideals or handle a project successfully. The project have to be well supervise to avoid error

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might hear what you said. One is that it means having room to make your own calls and shape the work. Another is that it means taking responsibility while being closely guided and checked. Which is closer to what you mean, or do you mean something else?

[USER]
Taking responsibly while being closely guided and checked.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else about how AI is affecting your work that you’d like to add?

[USER]
There is nothing else about how AI affect my work

[ASSISTANT]

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
data protection

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks. What does your day to day look like in your role?

[USER]
ensuring customer data is available whenever they require, restoring files, folders and servers back to either the original or alternative location, handling escalation cases from L1 and further escalating this to the vendor

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
proactivity, resolution issues within good time and good communication

[ASSISTANT]
When you say proactivity, what does that look like for you day to day?

[USER]
Whilst working on a case, if I see a fault, I fix it. If I see something that can prevent a fault, I implement it

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about resolving issues within good time, what does that mean in your work, and how do you tell you’ve hit that mark?

[USER]
meeting sla and kpi times

[ASSISTANT]
When you say good communication, what does that look like in practice with customers or with your colleagues?

[USER]
good customers updated on the case and keeping the team informed of business updates

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It helps enable automation, detection and availability

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent time when you used AI to enable automation in your work, step by step? What happened first?

[USER]
today, It helped me to create a script to pull data from the environment

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did the AI produce, and which parts did you write or adjust yourself?

[USER]
the graphql script as I am not knowledgeable

[ASSISTANT]
How did you check that the AI‑generated GraphQL script was correct before running it, and did anything go wrong when you first tried it?

[USER]
I didn't we run the commands and if it doesn't work, I inform the AI

[ASSISTANT]
The first time you ran a script without checking it, what went through your mind as you hit enter?

[USER]
intrigued as the account we used is read only, the script command only pulls data

[ASSISTANT]
Did the script return the data you were hoping for, and if not, what did you do next to get it to where you needed it?

[USER]
not at first, it required back and forth with the AI to resolve some parts

[ASSISTANT]
Which parts of the script needed changing, and how did you guide the AI to make those adjustments?

[USER]
pulling the SLA domains for rubrik, I asked it to give me diagnostic commands to see what commands or data we can pull

[ASSISTANT]
During that back and forth to fix the script, what stands out to you about that exchange—what was your gut response as it iterated?

[USER]
it attempts many commands to see what is available

[ASSISTANT]
How would you have approached pulling those SLA domains before you had this AI, and how does the new way compare for you?

[USER]
I would have used whatever reports that Rubrik provided or raise a case to the vendor

[ASSISTANT]
How did the time it took this way compare to using reports or raising a vendor case?

[USER]
well I haven't needed to raise a case and this way allows me to work on it when I have time

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
positive way to give me results

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific interaction with a customer or a teammate where using AI changed how that conversation or collaboration went? What happened?

[USER]
I advised them that I'm working on a script to pull the SLA details that contain data that the built=in reports do not have

[ASSISTANT]
How did they respond when you said you were working on a script, and what did that do to the interaction between you?

[USER]
positively and looking forward to what the outcome is

[ASSISTANT]
Has using AI changed what your manager expects from you in terms of speed, quality, or how you share updates?

[USER]
nothing of the sort, but excited to see the outcome

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
data deletion is one I wouldn't let AI handle

[ASSISTANT]
Why is data deletion important for you to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
data is important, if ai deletes data without s knowing, thats an issue

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled deletion, how do you think that would change your role on the team or the trust between you and others?

[USER]
we'd feel insecure about the use of ai and the customers data

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
monitoring issues to then informing us

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to hand over monitoring issues and alerting to AI? What makes that a good fit in your work?

[USER]
would save a lot of time for staff, the AI can check each device and report on any faults

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over monitoring and alerting, would it change how others see your contribution to the team, and in what way?

[USER]
no

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
to be able to pass over duties that do not require human interaction

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice in your role?

[USER]
checking alerts, logging a case and informing the customer

[ASSISTANT]
When AI handles alerts and customer updates, what decisions do you still want to make yourself?

[USER]
I guess where its checking alerts but I would let AI handle it all

[ASSISTANT]
What signs would tell you that you need to step in rather than letting it run?

[USER]
if no alerts are being acknowledged

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
not that I can think of

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers!

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm a Software Architect

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Ensuring the job is done to completion, on time and with real dedication.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say done to completion, what tells you it’s truly finished rather than just shipped?

[USER]
If the customer is happy, I am happy and the product quality is clearly delivering on its advertised value.

[ASSISTANT]
In your context, what does being on time look like, and how do you gauge whether you’re on track as the work unfolds?

[USER]
Delivering something on time is to ensure that all user stories are met from our design documents and to ensure that we've communicated any potential delays as early in the process as they're delivered. Ultimately the customer and our contractual terms defines this but informally we try to ensure the customer is receiving the best kind of client service.

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about real dedication, what does that look like in your day to day work?

[USER]
Going above and beyond to research into issues, work with colleagues and external acquaintances and just doing anything we can to make sure we keep delivering a product that leads the industry.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I typically use AI as a preliminary research tool, a way to summarize documents, and a way to mock up UI examples in a very rough and quick manner

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used it to summarize a document, step by step? What did you give it, what did it return, and what did you do next?

[USER]
I provided a technical document which outlined an integration API. I asked the AI agent to ingest the document first. This document was a first draft. I also provided a second completed API technical document as a reference and  then asked the agent to see if it can spot any potential holes in the implementation using the more completed document as a reference. I then asked it to summarize these for me

[ASSISTANT]
What kinds of gaps did it flag in the draft, and how did you check whether those were real issues?

[USER]
It flagged a couple of testing credential related issues, by referring to a more secure way in which we implemented it in the reference document. I checked they were real issues by using my own learned knowledge and by determining if they were contextually sensitive to the new API. They weren't entirely relevant, but this discovery meant I could update the API documentation to reflect this and assuage any doubts by those who read the document in the future.

[ASSISTANT]
When it surfaced those credential points, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
I was intrigued to think that this was an issue that was missed, or to know if it was really an issue in the broader context.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did the system actually do, and which parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
What exactly do you mean?

[ASSISTANT]
I mean in that workflow, what did the system actually produce, and what did you yourself write or decide?

[USER]
I produced the full API documentation and reference document. The system/agent provided a textual list of what I asked for in a summary

[ASSISTANT]
Were any of the system’s suggestions off base or misleading in that case, and if so, how did you handle them?

[USER]
In the early example I provided the system made a semi-valid point but in the broader business context it was a little off base. To handle this I simple added the greater context into the API documentation so that this kind of understanding isn't a worry in future.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved by having it surface those points and summarize them?

[USER]
I worked on other pressing matters in our development stack.

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing that document review with the system compare to how you would have handled it before you had these tools?

[USER]
Without these tools I'd have circulated it to our development and functional team and asked for review input. I still did this, however by using the AI tool I was able to waste less of my own time and everyone else's time by picking up on obvious issues earlier.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the last time you used it to mock up a UI—what did you ask for, and what did it give you?

[USER]
I asked the AI agent to mock up an internal portal for our functional team members which allowed them to access a summarized webview of progress and goals across multiple integration sources such as our external and internal ticketing systems and project tooling.

[ASSISTANT]
What did it give you back for that portal, and how did you use or change what it produced?

[USER]
It gave me back some boilerplate HTML and CSS. Mainly just the design and feel of the document. I used what it produced to circulate it internally towards our team to ask if such a feature/view would be usefull.

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned circulating it internally. How did your teammates react, and what stands out to you about that exchange?

[USER]
My target audience - the functional team - were rather intrigued by this but obviously our development team were more concerned with supporting a new feature. What stood out to me was that they assumed I'd spent a great deal of time on all of this, I'd in fact spent just a few hours of my own time.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about both the API review and the UI mockup, how did these tools affect your confidence in the work you were planning to ship?

[USER]
In terms of confidence the tools definitely validated and reinforced a lot of my work and thoughts and helped reduce any internal anxiety I had about moving forwards in our product pipeline.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it for preliminary research—what you were trying to find out, what you asked, and what you did with the results?

[USER]
I wasn't able to find any decent sources on a specific algorithmic optimisation online, and as such I asked the agent to find research and doctoral level references about this, which it was able to. I used the results to learn for upcoming projects.

[ASSISTANT]
When it returned those references, how did you judge whether they were solid enough to rely on?

[USER]
I visited the sources one by one and confirmed authenticity and actually read/purchased/acquired them after assessing the relevance.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I don't really think it's affected them at all on the surface. If anything we have less busy work conversations that could be avoided by just talking to an AI agent.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you describe a recent time when you would normally have gone back and forth with a colleague, but instead you used the tool, and how that changed the interaction with that person afterwards?

[USER]
Earlier I referenced a time where I used the AI to find gaps in a technical API document before circulating this to colleagues. By doing this I avoided multiple rounds of back and forth before I eventually circulated it.

[ASSISTANT]
How do your manager or clients view you using these tools—have they commented on it or set any expectations around it?

[USER]
There aren't really any comments nor expectations set. As with any work, if we produce work or effort we have to be able to justify and back it up with reasonable data and effort. Using AI tools doesn't change this mentality.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about mentoring and learning on the job, has using these tools changed how you coach teammates or how juniors come to you with questions?

[USER]
Not necessarily. If anything I teach juniors and teammates to do their own research before becoming reliant on AI tools so that they know how to validate and assess any information AI tools produce

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Finally hitting "send" on client based communication. I want ultimate responsibility on what leaves our organisation and team in terms of information. Not necessarily me, but a human.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes having a human press send so important to you in practice?

[USER]
Ensuring we have a full trail of responsibility and ensuring there's at least someone other than AI who knows what's being communicated. That level of autonomy is just too risky.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled pressing send on client communications, how do you think that would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
I think I'd be just as responsible for allowing the situation to be possible but less able to control it. The same for my colleagues.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Updating internal documentation as we ship new features, of course with approval oversight.

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to hand over the documentation updates—what makes that a good fit for the tool in your eyes?

[USER]
It's simply so time consuming and its something most code based agents should be able to handle if configured correctly in my experience

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled those documentation updates, would it change how others see your contribution to the team in any way?

[USER]
Absolutely not.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I'd tell them that it meant they'd have the ability to pursue tasks as they see fit and that they'd have all of the learning material available to learn at their own pace.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from the last month where you chose how to tackle a task and set your own learning pace?

[USER]
I looked at our internal development timeline and in my own time I researched algorithmic optimisation methods for a project that was all about implementing features such as this in our prediction and forecasting functionalities.

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might understand what you said—either choosing methods and tools day to day, or setting your own goals and timeline. Which is closer to what you mean, or is it something else altogether?

[USER]
A combination of both

[ASSISTANT]
In your current role, what are the practical limits on that—what boundaries or standards do you need to work within when you choose methods and set your own pace?

[USER]
We obviously have client and internal deadlines to meet but nothing says we cannot start projects earlier and move at a slower pace for a longer time. Also, we have educational limits and tooling limits when it comes to finances.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
In my industry as a whole within development there's a lot more shipped without real expertise due to AI and it's a very dangerous issue that will come back to undermine the industry in the coming years unless AI coding tools increase in quality 100 fold.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about AI’s impact on your work?

[USER]
On the whole it tends to save me and my team time.

[USER]
Is there anything else?

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks. Do you have anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work, or does this cover the important parts for you?

[USER]
That covers it all.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Duration: 122.18 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work in It managing a small IT department

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. What does a typical day look like for you when you’re managing the team and the department?

[USER]
I split my time between working with the department on support, they handle the first line support and I will  step in when required, and working on projects with other areas of the business, such as managing software integrations, networking and file storage

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
The main one for me which is the most rewarding is helping people using my knowledge and abilities

[ASSISTANT]
Besides being able to help people with your skills, what else matters to you in a good job?

[USER]
Learning new skills and feeling like I'm constantly progressing in some way

[ASSISTANT]
Is there anything about how the work is set up or how you work with others that you see as part of a good job?

[USER]
I definitely like working from home most of the time. I wouldn't want that to change.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
Relatively minimally. I rarely use it during work, I have spent more time working on rolling out new software which includes AI features and making sure they can't be abused

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent rollout that included AI features—what the tool was and what you had to configure on it?

[USER]
We've had to manage Copilot integrating itself into nearly every Microsoft product

[ASSISTANT]
In one specific case, what settings or controls did you put in place for Copilot, and what prompted those choices?

[USER]
I have been trying to remove it from Outlook as management aren't keen on all staff having access to it for email

[ASSISTANT]
What steps did you take to try to remove it from Outlook?

[USER]
There are settings in the admin center which should prevent it from appearing automatically, but it changed with a recent update

[ASSISTANT]
When the update changed that behavior, what did you do next to handle it?

[USER]
I returned to the admin center, there was another toggle to disable it which seems to have worked

[ASSISTANT]
When you saw it reappear despite the settings, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
It felt like AI features are being added whether we want them or not, and that we aren't supposed to opt out

[ASSISTANT]
Did staff notice it in Outlook and reach out to you—what happened on your side when it reappeared?

[USER]
Yes the operations manager flagged it to me that it was appearing prominently in the Outlook application so I then investigated and made the change

[ASSISTANT]
Apart from turning features off or limiting them, do you use any AI tools yourself for any part of your work?

[USER]
I rarely use them, sometimes for research like an enhanced search engine, occasionally to draft documents or messages that I will heavily edit, but I don't use it often

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used it to draft a document or message—what you asked it for, what it produced, and what you changed?

[USER]
It was a request to a supplier, it generated the skeleton of the message and I went through and added the specific details and checked everything made sense

[ASSISTANT]
When you reviewed that draft to the supplier, what stood out as needing the most reworking?

[USER]
I removed some of the typical AI phrases and changed it to be closer to something that I would write

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I can't say that it has really. I don't like to receive messages that I think have been AI generated which is why I heavily edit mine, but this doesn't really happen with people I work closely with.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Communication I think would be the key one. If I'm expecting to talk to a human it should always 100% be a human

[ASSISTANT]
What makes keeping communication in your own hands so important to you?

[USER]
Because 2 people having a conversation is a social activity, I don't ever want to talk to an AI when I could just look up the data I need

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent conversation at work where the human element really mattered and what made that exchange important?

[USER]
It's important because it fulfills a social need in a way that a conversation with a LLM cannot, and as I must spend much of my time at work I enjoy the conversations with my team and colleagues, I would not like to lose out on that

[ASSISTANT]
If AI started taking over some of those conversations, how do you think it would change your role on the team or your relationships day to day?

[USER]
I would lose interest because the conversations would not have the same meaning to me. I'd feel a lot more distant from those people

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
The stuff I find really tedious - budgeting, invoices and expenses. If AI could reliably track everything, generate the spreadsheets and send messages/files when required I would be very happy

[ASSISTANT]
What would need to be in place for you to fully trust an AI to handle budgeting, invoices, and expenses end to end?

[USER]
I'm not sure the company would allow it in any case, so it would need to be approved by the leadership team

[ASSISTANT]
Aside from leadership approval, what safeguards or trails would you want so you could sign off on its work with confidence?

[USER]
The data would need to stay local, it couldn't be sent to their servers so we would need to create a bespoke solution and run it locally

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Autonomy for me is about having the respect from your colleagues that you know what you're doing, that you can handle the responsibility of the job without excessive micromanaging, and that your opinions and decisions are respected

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of a time when you were given that trust at work and how you handled it in practice?

[USER]
New staff hires, I have refined the process for their first day in terms of the equipment and services they need, as long as I am supplied with the details at least 1 week in advance I can produce everythhing that is needed

[ASSISTANT]
In that new hire setup process, what told you that your colleagues respected your decisions — was there a moment or signal that made it clear?

[USER]
It was more what doesn't happen, there's no panicing or doubting that I will be prepared because I've proven myself before

[ASSISTANT]
Does anything about AI change what it takes to earn that kind of trust from colleagues or managers in your role?

[USER]
No I wouldn't say there is any link there

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t discussed?

[USER]
I can't think of anything else

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Interview 96
Username: 63469e0a9552017beb3cfb82
Date: 12/12/2025 18:34:30
Duration: 26.67 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work in IT as an IT manager, I am responsible for all enterprise hardware, such as firewalls, switches, servers, storage, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
One that is enjoyable to the person and fulfills them

[ASSISTANT]
When you say enjoyable, what does that look like in your day to day work?

[USER]
I find it fun to do, it is a challenge.  Challenging things make the day go by faster and leads me to feel that I accomplished something

[ASSISTANT]
When you say it fulfills you, what does that mean to you?

[USER]
As I mentioned, I feel like I accomplished something, inner pride that I completed it

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond the challenge and that sense of completion, what else matters most to you in a job?

[USER]
That I am treated with respect by my peers and leadership

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
We use it to monitor systems and accounts for unusual activity.  Does a person typically access that computer or this file in the daily worklife and if not, why are they doing so now.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent specific alert it raised—what it flagged and what you did next?

[USER]
I cannot give specifics, but I can discuss it if I censor some of the information.  Let's say a person all of a sudden started logging in from a different state, or country, out of the blue.   This would be a red flag and the system would challenge that person by triggering MFA.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, what parts did the system handle on its own, and what steps did you personally take once the MFA challenge was triggered?

[USER]
Nothing at that point, it is all automated.  If the account succeeds in the MFA challenge, it's marked as atypical behavior, but valid.  If there is a failure, the account is automatically disabled and an alert is sent to us.  The person receives a message to contact IT for assistance when they attempt to access anything.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a time when the system disabled an account but it turned out to be a legitimate login. What happened and how did you sort it out?

[USER]
That has never happened, so far.

[ASSISTANT]
When an alert does come in that an account was disabled after failed challenges, what goes through your mind in that moment, and what do you do first?

[USER]
We have someone contact the person via phone call, ask what happened, get any details that may be helpful in tracking down the source.    They have the password changed and continue on

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to before you had this system, how has the workflow around account anomalies changed for you and your team?

[USER]
Before we didn't necessarily know when something was occurring, we had no visibility

[ASSISTANT]
What stood out to you when you first started getting that visibility—what was your gut response to seeing those alerts?

[USER]
How unaware we were previously.  Luckily we had almost no cloud presence so the risk was minimal

[ASSISTANT]
Since putting this in place, how has it changed what you spend your time on during a typical day?

[USER]
It hasn't changed anything from that perspective.

[USER]
hello?

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for the nudge. Besides monitoring logins and account behavior, are there other ways AI shows up in your hardware or network responsibilities?

[USER]
I use it for writing scripts, very helpful in that regard.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the last script you asked it to help with. What did you need the script to do?

[USER]
I had it write a script to look for all enabled accounts in a specific OU and to report back any of those accounts that were not a member of a group.

[ASSISTANT]
In that script example, what did it produce on the first try, and what changes did you make before you were comfortable running it in your environment?

[USER]
The first iteration was entirely too complex and didn't work.  I let it debug a few times before I told it to make the script as simple as possible.  That one worked on the first try.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were iterating on that script and telling it to simplify, what went through your mind during that back and forth?

[USER]
I was wanting it to provide a good output and not the troublesome code it was giving me.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I have not seen a change there.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you think of a moment where AI touched a handoff with a colleague or a manager—maybe around an alert, a script, or a policy discussion—and tell me how that interaction went?

[USER]
The events I mentioned earlier would be one.  Once an alert is raised, we reach out to our Help Desk team to contact the person.

[ASSISTANT]
What typically stands out to you about coordinating with the Help Desk during those alerts?

[USER]
Nothing, it's as simple as a Teams message to the group.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I will always want to be aware and involved with any security events.  Not because it cannot handle it but because I want that information so I can stay informed about the company's safety.

[ASSISTANT]
What parts of a security event do you feel you personally need to see or decide in order to stay informed about the company’s safety?

[USER]
All of that information, the who, what, where, and why it occurred

[ASSISTANT]
What changes for you if you only received a brief summary of an incident instead of digging into the details yourself?

[USER]
I won't have the complete picture

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled the triage and investigation end to end and only pinged you when it was done, how do you think that would change your role on the team or your interactions with others?

[USER]
I would no longer be the point person who is contacted by any leadership that wants the information.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Any reports requested.  Active users, people who are over licensed, accounts not using email, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to hand off those reports—what makes them the kind of work you’d rather not spend time on?

[USER]
It's busy work and I could use my time in a more meaningful way.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those reports end to end, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
No, because they aren't highly visible reports, its usually for a single person.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close this out, if a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Having the skill to be able to make decisions that impact the company on one's own.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from the past few months when you made a decision on your own that affected the company, and walk me through what you did?

[USER]
Making decisions on how an acquired company is integrated into our IT systems.

[ASSISTANT]
What was the first concrete step you took in that integration, and what inputs did you rely on to make that call?

[USER]
How we would migrate email or data, in what order, and the schedule of it

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking back to the last integration where you set the email migration order, what exact order did you choose, and what risks or constraints led you to that choice?

[USER]
Moving accounts first, then data, finally email.  The main risk is losing email during the migration.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI has impacted your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
No, that's all

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Interview 97
Username: 6692e08ff27e0266c1ad1b91
Date: 12/12/2025 18:30:53
Duration: 34.26 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an IT Manager for a consulting firm. I work with different clients/companies to build out and develop CRMs for them based on their companies needs

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Do you mean a good job as in what makes having a certain job good?

[ASSISTANT]
Yes, exactly. When you think about a job being “good,” what matters most to you?

[USER]
I think there are many factors. I do lean towards jobs and companies that are big on employee satisfaction and well-being. I think it when a company takes care of their employees it really show that they care. When i say "take care" i mean in the sense of having a good benefits package, giving opportunities for employees to advance and training for new skills, giving fair compensation for the work and opportunity for promotion and raises.

[ASSISTANT]
Of the things you mentioned, which two matter most to you personally, and why?

[USER]
I would say a good benefits package as well as fair compensation and training

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time when strong training or fair pay changed how you approached your work?

[USER]
Yes, absolutely. My company offers paid training for employees to receive as many certifications that they want. I think it changed my perspective on many things. First, it was a way for me to gain knowledge and skills, and secondly, the more certifications I have the better pay I will get and the more opportunities open up for me

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use AI daily at work. I use it often in many circumstances. I use it to draft weekly and monthly client email updates about what stage their project is in and any updates. I also use it to help me build out and develop the custom CRM that the client wants. When i put the information into AI and tell it what I need it can create a flow for me in seconds that would otherwise maybe take me an hour or more. AI is also used in the clients CRMs in forms of chatbots and I use AI to help build out these chatbots and what the client wants it to say, how it should respond, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example of creating a flow in seconds, can you walk me through the last time you did that—what steps you took, and which parts you did versus what the AI produced?

[USER]
I started by explaining to the AI what the goal of the flow is. It asked me for the relevant objects and API names of the fields. After I gave it the information it needed, it started by building the design for the flow. After building it I asked it to provide me with test scripts and a user guide so that end users would know what to expect with the new active flow.

[ASSISTANT]
When it produced the design, test scripts, and user guide, what issues did you notice, if any, and how did you go about checking and fixing them?

[USER]
It doesn't always align with best practices and I had to ask it to scour the internet to make sure its providing information that is aligned with up to date, accepted standards

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized it might not align with current best practices, what went through your mind and how did you respond in that moment?

[USER]
That AI is helpful but still has a long way to go.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through your process for using it to draft a weekly client update, from the moment you prompt it to the moment you hit send?

[USER]
I provide it with the updates that I want to include in the email. I provide it with the tone I want to use in the email and I provide it with screenshots of past update examples.

[ASSISTANT]
After it drafts the email, what do you usually find yourself editing before you send it?

[USER]
Yes

[ASSISTANT]
What kinds of edits do you typically make before you send the email?

[USER]
Verbiage or spread sheet format updates

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it for these drafts, what stands out to you about how your workflow changes compared to doing them from scratch?

[USER]
It definitely makes things quicker even with the errors

[ASSISTANT]
When it saves you time on those drafts or flows, what do you usually do with that extra time?

[USER]
Other billable work that might need to be done

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the last chatbot you built with it—what did you ask it to do, and how did you test whether its responses matched what the client wanted?

[USER]
I was using it to build a bot that would provide customers with the ability to create and manage orders.

[ASSISTANT]
How did you test that bot before rollout—walk me through what you did to check its behavior and where it didn’t behave as expected.

[USER]
Tested it as a authenticated customer on the website

[ASSISTANT]
In that customer test, what didn’t work the way you wanted, and how did you go about fixing it?

[USER]
It had difficulty locating the customers account and it struggled with mathematics operations. WE had to make the instructions in the prompt more strict.

[ASSISTANT]
When the bot couldn’t find accounts and messed up the math, what was your gut reaction, and how did you handle that moment with the client or your team?

[USER]
My reaction was to go back and see what went wrong if anything and how it can be fixed

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I would say positive because I can help colleagues with issues they may  not solve on their own and able to assist clients faster

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent time when AI let you help a colleague faster—what happened, and how did that interaction go?

[USER]
I was able to help a colleague that isn't as familiar with AI build a flow and show them how I did it so they can learn and do it in the future

[ASSISTANT]
What did your colleague do or say afterward that stuck with you?

[USER]
They thanked me and told me that helping them and showing them how to use the AI is going to really help them in their job and time management

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I don't think so

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you comfortable with the idea of letting it handle any part of your job?

[USER]
The fact that it can get 30 hours of billable work done in less than 4 hours.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled most of the delivery work, how do you think that would change how your teammates or clients see your contribution?

[USER]
I think they would see me as more advanced because the faster I can get work done, the more the company can bill

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Creating meeting recaps

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about creating meeting recaps that makes you eager to hand it off?

[USER]
Having to do sumarizations of meetings can be time consuming

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI wrote your meeting recaps, what checks would you want to do before sharing them?

[USER]
I would check it over to make sure the information in it is accurate

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled the recaps, do you think it would change how teammates or clients use or respond to those notes in any way?

[USER]
I dont think so

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, if a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them having the ability to make my own choices when working with clients, not being micromanaged and obtaining as much skill as possible to make myself better at my job

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from a recent client project where you made your own call on how to proceed, and tell me what happened?

[USER]
I spoke with the client about what their needs were and what they wanted fixed in their crm and i used my expertise to determine what needed to be done and did it

[ASSISTANT]
What exactly did you decide to build or change in that CRM, and what options did you consider before choosing that path?

[USER]
they wanted to immediately go into using AI chatbots but i told them it was a bad idea because their users aren't even using the crm like they are supposed to and most didnt even know how

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about making your own choices, do you mean mainly choosing the method to meet a client’s goals, or choosing which goals and priorities to tackle in the first place—or do you mean something else entirely?

[USER]
I would say both but mainly what method is used

[ASSISTANT]
Can you share a recent moment when using AI changed how much freedom you had to choose the method—either giving you more room to decide or narrowing your options?

[USER]
When i use AI to create flows and weekly updates for me, it's given me more free time to work on more tasking projects that a client needs and brainstorm the best way to tackle it

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything we haven’t talked about that feels important about how AI is changing your work?

[USER]
no

[ASSISTANT]

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm a data analyst/team lead for Google in their AI department.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A place where you wake up in the morning and you're not dreading going in, there's no ill feeling towards your place of work, and you enjoy the company you have with your employees. You want to feel secure, and that you won't be judged for making mistakes.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say you want to feel secure, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
Just knowing I'm able to do my job without being scrutinised by anyone and I can get on with my work.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a moment when you really felt those things were present at work, enjoying your colleagues and not being judged for mistakes? What happened?

[USER]
We had a fairly big project going on, and we were under some time restraints which is normally the case at work. My boss could see I was struggling with stress, and they pulled me aside and assured me it was all going to be okay, and that we distributed the work load differently and I was able to concentrate more on the important things for the project.

[ASSISTANT]
Among the things you mentioned, which matters most to you and why?

[USER]
Having a support system at work. Knowing your colleagues aren't going to react in a negative way by making a mistake.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
We use AI specifically that we have developed ourselves. When we don't have big work on, we use it for summarising and sorting emails strictly.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used it to summarize emails—what you did and what it did?

[USER]
We use it daily for emails and to summarise, we get over 100 emails over night that we have the AI automatically sort for us, and it will make a note of it, for us to check the morning after. So, we don't have to do anything, the AI is automatically set up for it to do this. When we need it for something else, we will then programme it ready.

[ASSISTANT]
When you check the summaries the next morning, what exactly do you look for, and what kinds of things make you override or adjust what it produced?

[USER]
We have it set up so it will be able to detect keywords, and then simplify the emails and put them down to a couple sentences. With the amount of testing and work that has gone into this specific model, we do not need to make changes for this anymore, we've been working on it for years, and we've perfected it for this specific task.

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond the email sorting, can you tell me about a time you programmed it for another task and how that played out?

[USER]
In the past we have let it aid in code, so when we have a big project on, we will give it tasks, it tends to help with code error, but we are slowing implementing it, so it can assist with actually writing code. But for something that we do on a regular basis, it is programmed to detect error in the code, notify us of the specific code that is in question, it will offer a solution and then we will fix it ourselves.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the last time it flagged an error in your code—what was the issue it pointed to, and what steps did you take next?

[USER]
It was to do early on in a project, we were coding some work for logistics in the company and it spotted an error with how the charts were showing estimated delivery times. It was a very small and odd error, a few of us in the team weren't even sure as to why it was coming up as incorrect, but we eventually realised what had happened, the AI offered it's solution and we followed through by implementing it.

[ASSISTANT]
In that logistics incident, which parts did it handle and which parts did you and your teammates handle?

[USER]
It was just checking the code we provide for the AI to go over. Our team do all of the coding, in this scenario specifically.

[ASSISTANT]
When it caught that odd error in the delivery-time charts, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
Confusion, was my initial thought, as we don't tend to get a lot of errors, especially not for straight forward code, and something we do on the regular, but it was indeed strange, but that's what the AI is programmed to do, and we are thankful for that.

[ASSISTANT]
When it proposes a fix like that, how do you decide whether to implement it as is or dig deeper before making changes?

[USER]
Well, as we could see the code wasn't working as intended, so we knew something was amiss, and it was a logical fix. We tested it, and it worked. It's quite simple when it comes to fixes like that. It's a lot of trial and error, but for this, there was only 1 thing that it could have been.

[ASSISTANT]
What do you tend to do with the time you save in the mornings now that the email triage runs automatically?

[USER]
It gives me more time, sorting the tasks of my team, and allows me to focus more on the project earlier than usual. It's more about time saving.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking back to when you handled email triage and code checks without these tools, what feels different in your day now?

[USER]
It's more of a relief, knowing I don't have to do that mundane task, which was not good for productivity.

[ASSISTANT]
When you rely on a system your team built to take over that morning task, what stands out to you about how that changes your day or how you see your role?

[USER]
It hasn't changed my role much at all, I still do everything else, reading and going through emails was just part of my job that had to be done, until we programmed this AI to aid in that.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
We don't use AI for any sort of social activities in the office, but it has allowed our team to spend more time planning our actions for projects and other things, because of the time save that it is bringing us.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent interaction with a colleague or your manager that changed because you had that extra planning time? What happened?

[USER]
It's more noticeable during the beginning of a project, or something coming up. In the morning, it saves me a good hour or so, so I get to delegate jobs properly, and ensure that everyone is working to their strengths, which in turn makes everyone in my team happier.

[ASSISTANT]
When you delegate jobs more precisely at the start of a project, can you describe a moment where a teammate’s reaction stood out to you? What did you notice?

[USER]
We'd been having problems with some of the code, and we had a couple new faces in the office, who weren't too familiar with how we like to get things done, so I was unsure where to place them, and was having some difficulty, when I saw it wasn't going to plan, and I had to move things around, we had got to the point here where I was happy enough to give the AI the sole role of summarising the emails and allowing me more time in the mornings, to focus on getting the right jobs to the right people. Once I saw where we were going wrong, I could move people around and have them play to their strengths, which was vital with new people working with us.

[ASSISTANT]
What, if anything, has shifted in how your manager looks at your team’s pace or output since you started using these tools?

[USER]
Our output has definitely improved, it's given us more time to produce higher quality of work, which is always appreciated.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
We will never allow AI to interact with stakeholders, or higher up bosses. We keep those strictly personal, and it allows us to stay in contact and keep that closeness.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those conversations with stakeholders and senior leaders something you want to do yourself rather than have a system handle them?

[USER]
When you can put a face to a name, it looks like you're showing interest and putting effort into the job, and not just putting them onto an AI.

[ASSISTANT]
If a system handled those meetings for you, how do you think it would change your relationships with those people or your place in the team?

[USER]
It just shows a lack of professionalism to me. We want the people involved to feel like they are being respected and given the time of day. If we're directing them to an AI, and it's automated, it won't feel the same.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you think of a time when meeting someone in person or directly changed the outcome of a project or a decision? What stands out about that moment?

[USER]
Well, we've only ever dealt with people in person and we ensure we get it over the line.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily hand over to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I've already gladly put the email summarising over to the AI, the coding is something that is not part of my job but I do still help out, as I am the senior engineer in my team, but slowly the AI is being programmed to be able to perform to a very high standard and that is next to be a permanent feature.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes handing more of the coding work to a system appealing for you personally?

[USER]
It will be another time saver, as I have other jobs to do other than help out with code, the more I can put onto the AI, the more time it gives me to ensure the quality of the work is as good as it can be.

[ASSISTANT]
If more of the coding shifted to the system, do you think it would change how others view your contribution to the team? Why or why not?

[USER]
It's not part of my job anyway, so it was just something I help out with, if there's a problem, so no, I don't think it would. They understand my time is needed elsewhere.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would make sure they knew it isn't about doing what you want, it's about having trust in people and the space to use your own judgement. It allows me to choose how I come at a problem, I get to set my priorities, and then I can decide what is the best way to deliver the best I possibly can from not only me but my team. We don't need someone constantly looking at the little things. I am able to set the bigger goals, but for each day, my team have the freedom to do what they think is best, and take lead of your own situation.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent day when you set the priorities and your teammates chose their own methods, and how you knew it was working?

[USER]
The other week we had to turn around a product usage insight fast. I set the key questions we needed to answer and the order of priorities, then everyone tackled it their own way, one person coding in Python, another pulling data in SQL, another sketching visuals. It was pretty obvious it was working as I was left alone and I trust my team to come to me for any little issue.

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about trust and space, what guardrails do you set so people can choose their own methods without things sliding into chaos?

[USER]
The most important thing for me is making sure everyone is on the same page for our end goal, the last thing you want it is people confused as to what we're aiming to achieve as a whole. We set a time that we will check in with each other to discuss any issues that have arose, to ensure it doesn't get too deep and then a real problem. Lastly, I would say we have people share their drafts or anything they find, no matter how raw it is.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time when one of those check ins surfaced a problem early, and what you did right after that?

[USER]
last month, during a check in on a dashboard project, 1 member of the team realised their data source was missing key fields. Because we caught it early, we didn’t waste time building on incomplete data. I helped them adjust the query and reprioritised a couple of tasks, and by the next check in we were back on track. It was quick and easy to sort out.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything we haven’t talked about regarding how AI is changing your work that you think is important to add?

[USER]
No, I think we covered a lot on the subject and it's been a pleasure talking to you. Thank you.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers!

Duration: 28.24 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work for a healthcare company in Information Security. My role is a Cyber Security Engineer.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Providing deliverables timely, within budget, with high quality.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say high quality, what does that look like in the day to day for you?

[USER]
My job is to create systems and policies that protect the companies' data and systems from attacks, infiltration, and other malicious activities. This can be from an internal or external attacker.

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond timely delivery, budget, and quality, what else matters to you in a good job?

[USER]
Do you mean what doing a good job is or what do I consider good in a job/role/position?

[ASSISTANT]
Good question — I’m asking about what makes a job good to have. For you personally, beyond delivery, budget, and quality, what else matters?

[USER]
Oh. That would be flexibility, good teammates, good benefits (medical, etc.), remote opportunities, and work/life balance.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use AI in many facets of my role. Primarily for assistance in coding, scripting, and querying. I also use it to help with Standard Operating Procedures and best practices. I also use it for formatting and grammar checks when sending messages.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used it for coding or scripting—what were you building or fixing?

[USER]
I used it for writing a script today that would automatically compile multiple spreadsheets of data into one, then it would add specific charts, and add formatting. This would also be automatically delivered to stakeholders.

[ASSISTANT]
In that script, which parts did the AI generate, and which parts did you write or change yourself?

[USER]
It created the majority of the script including commenting. I had to revise a few steps to add specific attributes for Azure Key Vault.

[ASSISTANT]
Did it make any mistakes or miss anything important on the first run, and how did you catch that?

[USER]
There were a few errors in the initial script. I tested this in a sandboxed environment and provided feedback to the AI engine.

[ASSISTANT]
When those initial errors showed up in the sandbox, what went through your mind, and how did you react in the moment?

[USER]
I thought this was common as often it takes time for the engine to fully understand the use-case you are working toward.

[ASSISTANT]
When you review or correct the AI’s output, what is that experience like for you?

[USER]
It is quite simple. The output is usually pretty close. I just have to make a few modifications.

[ASSISTANT]
On that spreadsheet script, compared to doing it without AI, how did the time and effort differ for you?

[USER]
I could have done it without AI but it would have taken me 2-3 hours to get it perfect. With AI this took less than 45 minutes to complete.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that task?

[USER]
I moved on to other tasks. I was able to have 1:1s with my subordinates which helped free them up more for next week.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the last time you used it to help with a Standard Operating Procedure—what were you trying to produce, and how did you work with it?

[USER]
I used it to create an SOP for requesting an exclusion in our EDR/XDR application. Often vendors need exclusion for their software to function properly if the EDR/XDR sees the application as malicious and it is a false positive.

[ASSISTANT]
For that SOP, which parts did it draft, and where did you step in to shape or revise it?

[USER]
It drafted the entire process. I stepped in to revise it with company terminology, formatting, and the current SMEs of the EDR/XDR.

[ASSISTANT]
When it helps with messages or formatting, what stands out to you about hitting send on something it helped write?

[USER]
It writes emails in a much better tone than I do. However, it can sometimes be too lengthy and I either need to revise or tell it how many sentences I want the message to be.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I have not seen any positive nor negative affect on my work relationships.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you recall a recent interaction with a teammate or your manager where AI came up, even briefly? What happened in that exchange?

[USER]
We often discuss AI Security and AI Policy. I expressed the need and urgency of an AI policy. This got us started on a project to research and develop the policy.

[ASSISTANT]
How did those policy discussions change how you and your team handle day‑to‑day decisions about using these tools?

[USER]
We limited access to these systems to options we considered secure.

[ASSISTANT]
When your team knows you’ve used AI on a piece of work, how does that shape their view of your expertise, if at all?

[USER]
It is often not noticed or considered as long as the output is favorable and accomplishes the task.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Finance and HR would be hard things to hand over the AI as those are sensitive areas. I would only feel comfortable with this if we were only using a proprietary AI solution and had full control over the protection of the data.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you want to keep a human doing Finance and HR work even if a system could do it flawlessly?

[USER]
Data privacy, integrity, availability, and confidentiality

[ASSISTANT]
Can you think of a recent situation in Finance or HR–adjacent work where handling sensitive information really called for human judgment? What happened there?

[USER]
I cannot recall a specific situation.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Automation of Incident management

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you want to hand over incident management to a system?

[USER]
Most of the time it is a repetitive task with many false positives. Handing this over would create more time for creativity.

[ASSISTANT]
If a system handled most incident management, would that change how others see your contribution on the team?

[USER]
No. I would still be notified and use human judgement to make the call whether it is a serious threat or not.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
The ability to create your own schedule, take time off as needed, and create a work/life balance. I would also tell them they need to have self-determination and self-disciple. Some cannot handle that level of freedom within their job.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a recent example that shows what that looks like in practice—maybe a day or week where you set your own schedule and balanced things the way you wanted?

[USER]
I always make my own schedule around other meetings or events I need to attend. I like to begin work earlier than most but that also leaves me the option to sign off earlier to spend time with family or friends.

[ASSISTANT]
When an urgent security issue pops up outside your preferred hours, how do you handle it while protecting the balance you described?

[USER]
I tend to it if serious along with other teammates. If I or any other teammate is on vacation, I tell them sign completely out of all communication platforms (email, MS Teams, etc.) Since we prioritize well qualified individuals and pay them accordingly, I feel comfortable for anyone on my team to be able to handle the incident.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say self‑discipline, what does that look like for you on a tough day?

[USER]
The ability to focus on your job and complete required tasks without being distracted or prioritizing other want. It is also the ability to be responsible for your own growth by staying up to date about the industry and advancements.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is impacting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
It is making it more difficult to implement data privacy because AI is now implemented into all applications in all functional areas.

[ASSISTANT]
That makes sense, especially with every tool sneaking in new features. Is there anything else you want to add before we close?

[USER]
No, I think that is all.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

[USER]
4

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for taking the time to share your experiences. Your perspective on security engineering and the day-to-day impact of these tools was really valuable. Wishing you and your team the best as you shape your policies and workflows.

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm team leader in a technology delivery team at a university

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
One that pays well and is satisfying with good holidays and a nice people to work with

[ASSISTANT]
When you say satisfying, what makes it satisfying in your mind?

[USER]
Usually helping people and making their lives easier

[ASSISTANT]
When you picture “nice people to work with,” what does that look like in your day-to-day?

[USER]
they are chill, polite and professional

[ASSISTANT]
Of the things you mentioned, which one feels most important to you right now?

[USER]
probably working with good people

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
Our IT service desk has chat bot that you can ask questions too and get support before calling and emailing the human team - as we are 2nd line support this has reduced a lot of our minor support calls we often got so we can focus on other things now

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent example of an issue the chatbot handled that used to land with your team, and what you did with the time or attention freed up?

[USER]
It helps users with minor problems like how they reset their password or guidance with using software, so we've been able to focus on rolling our more entra built laptops and upgrading AV in lecture theatres

[ASSISTANT]
In those password reset or software guidance cases, what does the bot actually do step by step, and what happens on your side if it needs to escalate?

[USER]
In the password reset it will assess whether the user is on campus or off campus and direct how to reset their password (either a web link or pressing crtl alt del and resetting their)

[ASSISTANT]
When the bot can’t resolve one of those cases, how does the handoff to your team work in practice, and what do you do once it lands with you?

[USER]
It emails the IT service desk with the username, contact details and the conversation they've had

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time the bot gave the wrong guidance, and what you did next?

[USER]
It didn't recognise that the issue the user was having was because their laptop was no compliant with our cybersecurity policies so the service desk did further checks in intune for that and then we had to get hold of the laptop to get it compliant again

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when you realized the real issue was compliance and the chat had missed it?

[USER]
It wasn't too big of a deal, the bot did its best and we were still able to quickly diagnose the issue and get it sorted with minimal impact to the user. It would be nice if the chatbot was more agentic and could access intune/entra and other systems to diagnose and assess issues at a deeper level but we aren't quite there yet I don't think

[ASSISTANT]
When the bot took those smaller queries off your plate and you shifted to rolling out laptops and upgrading AV, what stood out to you about how that change felt day to day?

[USER]
it was just nice to have less of thoses niggly small issues that can take up time, arranging contact with the user, speaking with them on MS Teams, listening to the problems and diagnosing the issue - it means be can dedicate uninterupted time to other tasks

[ASSISTANT]
When you step in after the bot misses something, does that feel like you’re putting your expertise to good use, or more like cleanup work?

[USER]
Putting our knowledge to good use I suppose, its nice to think that it can't completely do our jobs... but maybe that will change in the next year or two O_o

[ASSISTANT]
How do you decide when to trust what the bot has done versus doing your own checks?

[USER]
There is someone on the service desk that periodically does random checks on the chatbots work to see how it is doing and we also get user feedback as well

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking back to before the bot, how would one of those password reset cases typically unfold from first contact to resolution?

[USER]
They would call or email the service desk to say they can't login, the service desk would then ID them and either direct them on how they can reset their password or something manually do it themselves and verbally give the password to the user

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
sorry one sec there is someone at my door

[ASSISTANT]
No problem, take your time. Just let me know when you’re back and we can pick up where we left off.

[USER]
oaky back now - sorry. It hasn't affected my working relationships too much other than the team getting called away less times to go and help someone - as now the chatbot has taken care of the issue so I suppose the team spends more time together or team tasks

[ASSISTANT]
When the team spends more time together, how has that changed the way you coordinate work or talk to each other?

[USER]
I hadn't really thought about it like that but we do seem to get along better and the work is more enjoyable with out us having to go and help someone with what we perceive to be the more obvious easy  issues to solve

[ASSISTANT]
Have your managers or stakeholders noticed any change in your team’s work since the bot went live, and what have they said or done in response?

[USER]
No that I'm aware of but the chat bot has only been going for about 2 months

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I think probably handing a laptop over to a new member of staff and giving them an introduction to using it and an overview of our systems - that is better with a personal human touch in my opinion

[ASSISTANT]
Why is that handover and introduction important for you to keep rather than handing it to an AI?

[USER]
well they are completely new to the institution and I think a human does a better job of assessing their needs and guiding them to how things work at your Uni

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over that handover and introduction, how do you think it would change your relationships with new starters or your role on the team?

[USER]
we would be more distant to our staff and they might not know that they can come to us for help

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Possibly some of our cyberessential requirements with regard to device compliance, as it can be tricky to track people down and get the device compliant again, sometimes they need a complete rebuild

[ASSISTANT]
What makes that device compliance work the thing you’d most like to hand off?

[USER]
It can just be a bit of a pain getting them compliant again, they is a lot of rebooting, syncing waiting and checking systems to see if the device has become compliant again and it feels quite random as to when that will happen so it can be a bit of time sink

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled that compliance work end to end, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
no I don't think so we still have plenty of other things to do, it would be interesting to see how an AI handles that though

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
It would be having the freedom to complete your set of tasks in the best order you think

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of a day when you chose the order of tasks yourself, and how that played out?

[USER]
I usually have a list of 5-12 tasks to do in a day, to be honest I often just try to get the tricky ones out of the way first so I have an easier afternoon

[ASSISTANT]
On a day when a high‑priority request comes in from a bot escalation, what do you do with your planned order for the day?

[USER]
I can either get one of my team to help out while I go and sort out the high priority issue or send one of my team to do it so I can carry on with my tasks, it depends on the situation

[ASSISTANT]
At the end of a day, what tells you that the way you ordered your tasks worked well?

[USER]
Usually that I've got all the tricky jobs out of the way and I just have a couple of easy fixes like sending a few emails or chatting with another team

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
no I don't think so

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. Do you feel there’s anything we missed or anything you want to add before we close?

Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
i am an IT expert in my dormain field

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
1. Meaningful Work

A sense of purpose or meaning in the work you do can make a huge difference. When people feel like their contributions matter or that their work aligns with their values, they're more likely to feel fulfilled. Meaningful work doesn’t necessarily have to change the world—just knowing your efforts are having a positive impact or that you're growing as a person can be enough.

[ASSISTANT]
That makes sense. What else would you put on the list of what makes a good job?

[USER]
Variety and Challenge – Keeps work interesting and prevents boredom.

Healthy Relationships – Positive colleague interactions make work more enjoyable.

Strong Leadership – Effective bosses provide support and clear direction.

[ASSISTANT]
If you had to choose just one of those to prioritize in a job, which would you pick, and what makes it stand out for you?

[USER]
I'd prioritize meaningful work. It gives purpose and makes challenges feel worthwhile. When you believe in what you're doing, it keeps you motivated, even during tough times.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
Automation of Tasks – AI can automate repetitive tasks like data entry, system monitoring, or troubleshooting, freeing up IT teams to focus on more strategic work.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used AI to automate something in your IT role? What was the task?

[USER]
Detect anomalies in system performance (like unusual spikes in CPU usage or network traffic).

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, what parts did the system handle on its own, and what parts did you step in to do yourself?

[USER]
Continuous Monitoring – The AI system automatically tracks server performance, network traffic, and system logs 24/7. It checks for anomalies such as unusual CPU spikes, memory usage, or network bandwidth congestion.

[ASSISTANT]
When it flagged an anomaly, what did you do next in that instance? What were the concrete steps you took?

[USER]
Review the Alert: Check the anomaly details (time, severity, affected systems).

Analyze Logs/Metrics: Pull system and network logs to understand the issue.

[ASSISTANT]
After you analyzed the logs and metrics, what was the next action you took in that situation?

[USER]
After analyzing the logs and metrics, I'd verify the impact by checking if users are affected and assessing related systems. If it's critical, I'd take immediate action, like scaling resources, restarting services, or blocking traffic.

[ASSISTANT]
Has the monitoring ever flagged something that turned out to be a false alarm, or missed an issue you later discovered? What happened in that case?

[USER]
False Alarm:

What happened: The monitoring system flagged an anomaly, like a spike in traffic, but it turned out to be a scheduled maintenance or a temporary, harmless surge.

Action: I’d review the context (e.g., scheduled tasks, updates) and verify that everything was within normal limits. If it was a false alarm, I’d adjust thresholds or add exclusions to avoid future triggers.

[ASSISTANT]
When an alert pops up, especially outside regular hours, what goes through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
nothing really

[ASSISTANT]
How does handling these spikes with the monitoring system compare to how you handled them before you had these tools?

[USER]
Before monitoring tools, handling spikes was manual and reactive—checking systems regularly, relying on user reports, and spending time identifying issues through logs. With AI tools, I get real-time alerts, automated anomaly detection, and faster, more proactive responses, reducing downtime and improving efficiency.

[ASSISTANT]
When these tools save you time, what do you usually do with that time?

[USER]
invest in doing other important activities

[USER]
hello,we good..

[ASSISTANT]
When you review or correct the system’s alerts, what does that work feel like to you?

[USER]
Before AI, I had to manually check systems and react to issues as they came up. With AI tools, I get real-time alerts and automated detection, allowing for faster, proactive responses and less downtime.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the most challenging incident you’ve handled with the help of these tools. What stands out to you about that situation?

[USER]
The most challenging incident was a DDoS attack. AI flagged unusual traffic and applied rate-limiting, but the attack still caused some performance issues.

[ASSISTANT]
In that DDoS moment, what was your gut response when you saw the alerts and the performance dip?

[USER]
Exactly, that’s spot on! The immediate priority is always containment—stop the bleeding and make sure things don’t escalate further. The AI’s automated steps were a great first line of defense, but it’s about knowing when to step in with human judgment to scale up the response.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Exactly, that’s the gist of it! By offloading the repetitive tasks, AI really allows the team to focus on problem-solving and innovation, which strengthens the overall dynamic.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example of a recent interaction where using these tools changed how you collaborated with a teammate or a manager? What happened?

[USER]
Sure! In a recent server outage, the AI flagged the issue, provided details on the cause, and suggested a fix. I shared the insights with my teammate and manager, allowing us to act quickly without wasting time on back-and-forth.

[ASSISTANT]
Was there any moment in that outage where you and your teammate or manager disagreed with the system’s suggested fix? If so, how did you work through that?

[USER]
none

[USER]
there is none

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
i don't think of any

[USER]
there is none

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily hand over to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
yes i would proudly hand over

[ASSISTANT]
Which specific task would you hand over to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
automation

[ASSISTANT]
What kind of automation are you thinking about handing over first? Can you name a specific task or workflow?

[USER]
all the automated tasks

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up those automated tasks?

[USER]
they are sometimes tiresome

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked what it means to have real say over how you do your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
i would just tell him to go school

[ASSISTANT]
What would you want them to learn in school that actually helps them have real say in their day‑to‑day work?

[ASSISTANT]
You have cancelled the interview.

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a lead backend engineer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job is one where you’re paid fairly, treated with respect, able to grow, and not stressed all the time. It should give you some balance in your life and make you feel like what you’re doing actually matters.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about being paid fairly and treated with respect, what does that look like in the day to day of a job?

[USER]
To me, it’s pretty simple in day-to-day terms: being paid fairly means I’m earning enough for the work I’m doing and I don’t feel underpaid or taken advantage of. Being treated with respect looks like people talking to me professionally, listening to my ideas, not talking down to me, and valuing the effort I put in. It’s just feeling like what I do and who I am actually matter at work

[ASSISTANT]
When you say being able to grow, what does growth look like for you in the day to day?

[USER]
it ust means I’m learning new things, taking on tasks that challenge me a bit, and not feeling stuck doing the exact same thing every day.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say you want the work to feel like it matters, what tells you that in a typical week?

[USER]
I know my work matters when what I do actually helps someone, makes a process easier, or my team notices my effort. Even small wins like that make the week feel meaningful.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI helps me get work done faster and easier. It can suggest solutions, write bits of code, or handle boring tasks, so I can focus on the important stuff.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it on a real task at work? What was the task?

[USER]
The last time I used AI at work was when I was building a backend feature for a project. I needed to write some API logic and test different ways to handle data. AI helped me generate the code faster and suggested a few approaches I hadn’t thought of, which saved me time and made the solution cleaner.

[ASSISTANT]
In that feature, which parts did the work come from the tool and which parts did you do yourself?

[USER]
AI wrote the basic code and gave me some ideas, but I did the important parts myself, figuring out how it should work, connecting it to the database, and making sure it fit with the rest of the project.

[ASSISTANT]
Did the tool make any mistakes or suggest anything off in that work, and if so, how did you handle it?

[USER]
Yes, the AI sometimes suggested code that didn’t quite fit or wouldn’t run properly. When that happened, I double-checked it, fixed the errors, and adjusted the approach so it worked correctly. Basically, I used its suggestions as a starting point, but I had to make sure everything actually made sense.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were reviewing and fixing its output on that feature, what went through your mind?

[USER]
I was mostly thinking, “Does this actually work? Will it cause problems later?” I checked for mistakes and figured out how to fix or tweak the AI’s suggestions so everything ran smoothly.

[ASSISTANT]
When you used it on that feature, did it change how long the work took, and if so, what did you do with the time you freed up?

[USER]
Yes, it made the work faster. With the extra time, I focused on the harder parts and tested everything properly to make sure it all worked well.

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it on a task like that, how does it affect your confidence in the final code?

[USER]
It usually makes me feel a bit more confident, because I can compare my work with its suggestions. I still double-check everything, but it’s nice to have a second opinion.

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing that feature with the tool compare to how you would’ve done it before you had it?

[USER]
Before AI, I’d spend more time googling, checking docs, and writing everything from scratch. With the tool, it was faster and smoother. I still had to think through the main logic, but it helped me get past the slow parts quicker.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time when using it didn’t help or even got in the way? What happened?

[USER]
Yeah, sometimes it gets in the way. There are times it gives me code that looks right but doesn’t actually fit what I’m doing. Then I spend extra time fixing things or rewriting it myself, which kind of defeats the purpose and slows me down.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It hasn’t changed things a lot, but it helps a bit. Since it saves me time, I can focus more on talking with my team instead of being stuck in small tasks. It just makes collaboration a little easier.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent moment when collaboration felt easier because of it? What happened in that interaction?

[USER]
Recently, we were figuring out a tricky part of an API. AI helped me quickly draft an example, so I could show the team something clear right away. It made the discussion faster and easier.

[ASSISTANT]
How did your manager or teammates respond to you bringing that AI‑drafted example into the discussion?

[USER]
They were positive about it. Having a clear example made it easier for them to understand what I meant, and it helped us make decisions faster.

[ASSISTANT]
Has using it changed what happens in code reviews with your teammates?

[USER]
Yes, a bit. Since AI helps me catch small mistakes and write cleaner code upfront, reviews are usually quicker and focus more on logic or bigger design decisions instead of tiny errors. It makes the process smoother for everyone.

[ASSISTANT]
Has it changed how you mentor junior engineers or pair with teammates during tricky debugging or design sessions?

[USER]
Yes, it helps a lot. I can use AI to quickly make examples or show solutions, so when I’m helping juniors or working with teammates on tricky problems, I can focus on explaining things instead of writing every line myself. It makes learning and problem-solving easier.

[ASSISTANT]
Has it changed what your manager expects from you in terms of turnaround time or scope of work?

[USER]
A little bit. Since AI lets me get things done faster, there’s sometimes an unspoken expectation that I can handle more work or deliver quicker.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Yeah, I wouldn’t want AI to handle the parts that need real judgment, like making big decisions, understanding the context, or working with people.

[ASSISTANT]
Why are those judgment calls and context-heavy parts important for you to keep rather than hand over?

[USER]
they need real understanding and experience. AI can follow rules, but it can’t fully get the bigger picture or know what really matters.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent judgment call you made where context really mattered, and what stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
Recently, I had to decide how to handle a tricky feature that affected other parts of our system. AI could suggest code, but only I could judge the risks and pick the approach that made sense. The bigger picture mattered more than just the code.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over those judgment calls, how do you think it would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
If AI made those decisions, my teammates might rely on me less, and I’d feel more like I’m just doing tasks instead of helping guide the team.

[USER]
If AI made those decisions, my teammates might rely on me less, and I’d feel more like I’m just doing tasks instead of helping guide the team.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I’d happily let AI handle the boring, repetitive stuff, like writing basic code, fixing small bugs, or doing routine docs. It saves time and doesn’t need much thinking.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those repetitive tasks the kind you want to hand off—what is it about them in your day to day that you’re glad to be rid of?

[USER]
they just slow me down. They take time but don’t really teach me anything or move the work forward in a meaningful way. Getting rid of them lets me focus on the parts I actually enjoy and that really matter.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those repetitive tasks, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
I don’t think it would hurt how people see me. If anything, it might help, because I’d have more time to focus on the bigger, more meaningful parts of the work.

[USER]
I don’t think it would hurt how people see me. If anything, it might help, because I’d have more time to focus on the bigger, more meaningful parts of the work.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I’d say autonomy means being able to make your own decisions and solve problems your way. You get to figure out how to do your work, take responsibility for it, and decide when to ask for help or take the lead.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice on a recent project?

[USER]
On a recent project, I had to build a feature that touched several parts of our system. I decided how to structure the code, which approach to take for tricky parts, and when to ask teammates for input. I wasn’t just following instructions, I made choices about the best way to get the work done and owned the results.

[ASSISTANT]
When an AI offers a solution on a project like that, how do you decide whether to follow it or stick with your own approach?

[USER]
I look at whether the AI’s suggestion actually fits the problem and the bigger picture.

[USER]
I look at whether the AI’s suggestion actually fits the problem and the bigger picture.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you overruled its suggestion and what made you decide to do that?

[USER]
The last time I overruled its suggestion was when it offered a solution that looked clean but didn’t fit how the rest of the system was designed. If I had used it, it would’ve caused problems later and made the code harder for the team to maintain.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t talked about yet?

[USER]
no nothing

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hello. I'm a principal software engineer, I lead a department of 30 engineers within the pensions industry building the next generation of administrative tooling

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Fulfillment and clear objectives, being able to succeed at the role and feel good about it

[ASSISTANT]
When you say fulfillment, what does that look like for you in a typical week? What tells you you’ve hit that feeling?

[USER]
Good question. I suppose starting the week with an unmet objective and ending the week with a resolutionin place, completing the goal to the satisfaction of a stakeholder. That could be individual contributor (IC) work, or leadership

[ASSISTANT]
What helps make an objective feel clear and achievable for you?

[USER]
Understanding and marking deliverable milestones towards the end objective

[ASSISTANT]
Is there anything else that matters most in a good job for you?

[USER]
Pay, of course. Being able to sustain my lifestyle as a bare minimum of the job is important

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
Sure. Code generation has become trendy and is seen as a force multiplier within software engineering. It allows people with no history or training to create /something/, whereas existing skilled engineers can create /more/ and faster.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent task where you used it in your own work? What was the task, and how did you bring the tool into it?

[USER]
My typical usage is for script creation. If i have a manual process, or a process that I'm not 100% confident with that can be scripted, AI is very good at iterating on that process tro find an automated solution.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking of the last script you built this way, what did the AI generate first, and what parts did you end up changing yourself?

[USER]
The "skeleton" of a script is generally my first approach. I'll outline the requirements in clear instructions, note any constraints or considerations, and then "fill in the blanks" so to speak.

[ASSISTANT]
In that last case, which parts did the tool actually write, and which parts did you write yourself?

[USER]
A good example is a script which processed the contents of a download from the UK government. Every 90 days we have to rotate some crypto material (certificates, keys etc). This can manually take ~5 minutes or so, however a script could automate the steps and have it take 10 seconds.

I prompted the AI tool with the individual requirements (combining a leaf certificate with the chain, extracting the JWT private signing key etc) which took a few iterations to get correct. This formed the skeleton.

Once that was done, I considered how we as a business may interact with this script. I began to parameterise various components of it, allowing value substitution where useful.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, did the tool make any mistakes or misunderstand anything in those early iterations, and how did you handle that?

[USER]
Yes. When not being explicitly clear, ie implications are made or assumptions are needed, guesswork comes into play for the AI output. That has to be manually caught, then fixed either through clarification or manual interventionm

[ASSISTANT]
When you spotted that guesswork in the output, what went through your mind in the moment?

[USER]
I tried to apply how I designed the prompt to the output to spot the error. That helps me understand what I may need to clarify in a follow-up prompt, but also learn how to better phrase prompts in the future

[ASSISTANT]
When you were reviewing and correcting that script, what stood out to you about that experience?

[USER]
It was quick and mostly accurate. It would have taken me a few hours to create it, with AI it took seconds.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that script?

[USER]
Picked up other tasks elsewhere in the business

[ASSISTANT]
Did using the tool leave you feeling more confident in the result, or less, and what led you to that judgment?

[USER]
Neither

[ASSISTANT]
How does doing this kind of scripting with the tool compare to how you handled similar work before you had it?

[USER]
It's a time save. If I'm not manually doing it then I still need to understand the output to validate it before it gets used against secure or sensitive materials.

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond scripting, where else has it changed your day to day, either in your own work or in how you lead the team?

[USER]
it being AI?

[ASSISTANT]
Yes, I mean the AI tools like the one you used for scripting. Outside of scripting, has it changed how you lead the team in any way?

[USER]
No, it has no input on the human element of my role

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
As far as I'm aware it hasnt. It's a tool, in the same way a hammer hasn't impacted my working relationships

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Creative problem solving. It's the reason I love my career, handing that over to AI would make it feel pointless.

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about the process of creative problem solving that you most want to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
Going from completely confused to delivering a solution. It's a great element of job satisfaction that would turn my job into a chore if it was given to AI.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled that kind of problem solving, how do you think it would change your role on the team or how others see your contribution?

[USER]
It would make me into a principal prompt engineer (tongue in cheek joke). I wouldn't be a leader of problem solving with technology, just a guy who used to solve the problems but now delegates that to an LLM

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Hmm, good question. I suppose I have several tasks that are repetitive related to the continuity/maintenance of services built in the past. I'm a subject matter expert, therefore I'm involved in the upkeep of these services. If I could transplant that knowledge into an AI and automate the crud work, that would free me to be more impactful elsewhere.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those upkeep tasks feel like good candidates for an AI to take over?

[USER]
They're repetitive, repeatable and validatable stepped procedures. Think: download an item, run the script called X.ps1, check the output, ensure the file Y.pem is structured in Z way.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled those upkeep tasks, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Being able to decide what you're working on and how it's achieved. You would still be accountable for the delivered work, but being able to choose your own approach or solution would be full autonomy.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from recently where you had that level of choice—what was the situation, and what choices did you make about what to work on and how to do it?

[USER]
The scenarios we've discussed today have been within those parameters

[ASSISTANT]
How do you tell, at the start of a piece of work, that you actually have that freedom you’re describing? What are the signs you look for?

[USER]
I don't have a set of tools dictated at me to use, just the problem statement and typically a deadline

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re handed just a problem statement and a deadline, what’s the very first thing you do to set your own direction?

[USER]
Analyze and understand the problem, check affected areas if it's something with an existing system and then begin to formulate an approach. I don't involve AI in this process and never will

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
No, thank you!

[ASSISTANT]

Duration: 54.96 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hi, I'm a senior Linux and Unix Systems Administrator for a managed services IT company

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
The job should be interesting, well rewarded and have flexible working patterns specifically related to being able to work from home.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say interesting, what does that look like for you in day-to-day work? What kinds of problems or situations keep you engaged?

[USER]
My day to day role can include responding to incidents generated by automated monitoring, such as disk space, high cpu, high memory etc. We respond to those by checking the systems manually and resolving the issue. We also deal with requests from end users which is when some particular application isn't working, or we may have to install software. We also periodically patch/update the systems and we also have to install new virtual machines at the request of the customer. Most of this work can be interesting although some of it can also be repetitive.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say well rewarded, what does that mean to you — is it mostly about pay, or are there other forms of recognition or progression that matter?

[USER]
I think mainly about pay but in my company, annual pay rises are not automatic and therefore we often fall behind the national average wage wise. I would also include flexible working locations as a perk.

[ASSISTANT]
When you mention flexible working from home, what kind of flexibility matters most to you in practice — is it about location, hours, or something else?

[USER]
I prefer to work from home on a full time basis. I have been allowed this flexibility as I am a senior professional. The company policy is for individuals to work from the office at least 2 days per week but they are reviewing this to increase this to three days per week.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
My company hasn't got an ai policy so it is up to the individual. They have however, recently removed Microsoft Copilot from the company laptops, so I would say that they are discouraging the use of AI for us. I rarely use AI at work, but do use the AI summaries generated by Google and Bing searches.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used an AI summary in a search to solve a work problem? What was the task and what did you do with the info it gave you?

[USER]
If I have an issue that I can't find the answer to I would use a google search and quite often the AI summary at the top would be what I would first explore - that generally provides me the answer I need. I can't think of a specific example. It would generally be a google search on a linux error and I would be searching for examples of fixes of this.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you recall a recent Linux error where the AI summary shaped your next step? What was the actual error message you searched for, and what did you do right after reading the summary?

[USER]
I think there was a CIFS mount error that I noted in the logs and AI would have pointed me to a Red Hat resolution - which I tried out. However, this didn't resolve the issue.#

[ASSISTANT]
When the Red Hat resolution didn’t fix it, what was your next move? Walk me through the steps you took after that.

[USER]
I have logged a call with Red Hat, but haven't got much further with this at the moment.

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when the suggested fix didn’t work, and how did that shape how you used AI or other sources on this issue?

[USER]
I use google in the same way as I normally do. If the AI summary doesn't provide me with the answer I need I will manually search google pages for other answers.

[ASSISTANT]
Besides those search summaries, are there any other ways you use AI in your day-to-day work, even informally?

[USER]
No I haven't really needed to do this. I think I have used it to help with scripting in the past, but I don't use it regularly as part of my job. I'm more likely to use AI for entertainment purposes.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a time you used it for scripting. What was the script meant to do, and what did you do with the output it gave you?

[USER]
I can't remember the specific time or the details of what I used AI for. It may have been to try to create a script to copy files to servers or it may have been to gather audit information.

[ASSISTANT]
When an AI summary looks promising, how do you check that the advice is safe to run in your environment before you try it?

[USER]
I often check through the google results to see if other people have mentioned using this. Also, experience often tells you whether a command looks right or not.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to how you worked before these AI summaries were available, does using them change how long it takes you to resolve an issue? What’s different about your workflow when you do use them?

[USER]
I don't think that AI has particularly speeded up my job and I very rarely use it. It is generally useful if I have a large amount of information to collate and report on, but this is not a large part of my job.

[ASSISTANT]
When your company removed Copilot, how did that decision affect how you approach using these tools at work, if at all? What was your gut reaction to that change?

[USER]
I was surprised why they removed this tool and asked my manager about it. I think they have removed it until they decide upon an AI strategy which they haven't yet. If I need to use AI for work, I would have to use my mobile or go specifically to a web page of an AI engine.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
At the moment AI has had no real impact on my role at work, though I can see it having an impact on more junior roles in the industry

[ASSISTANT]
Have you had any conversations with colleagues or managers about using or not using AI at work? What were those conversations like?

[USER]
We were talking yesterday about it. I believe that one of the reasons given for removing copilot was that a more junior member of staff used the output from AI to send to a customer. Unfortunately the output that was sent to the customer was incorrect and the customer complained and highlighted this.

[ASSISTANT]
What stood out to you about how your team reacted to that incident, and did it change what’s expected when people check their work before sending anything to clients?

[USER]
I think that the stand out point from this is, using AI is frowned upon and my manager would ban it's use if he had his way. This is because people trust the output of AI but AI isn't always 100% accurate. You need to be able to use your experience to quantify whether the AI answer looks correct in the same way as you would in a google search.

[ASSISTANT]
After that incident, has anything changed in how junior staff get their messages or fixes reviewed before sending them to clients?

[USER]
I am not privy to that sort of information and I am not really involved with those teams.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I am not sure that AI can do everything perfectly yet. The AI would need to be able to make decisions on how to fix a problem that the customer requests. For disk space issues, it would need to know what logs should and shouldn't be rotated. The AI would need to be fully trained as person would be.

[ASSISTANT]
If we imagine, just for the sake of discussion, that an AI really could do a task flawlessly, is there any part of your work you would still want to keep in your own hands? What would that be?

[USER]
Maybe AI could do the more mundane tasks, but I would still want to be able to troubleshoot issues. I guess my future role might involve supervising AI's mistakes or double checking AI's work for mistakes.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is troubleshooting the part you’d want to keep in your own hands? What makes that important for you compared to letting an AI handle it?

[USER]
I think that AI can help with troubleshooting, by presenting fixes, but does it have the ability to know which thing will fix a problem if there are 3 or more options? I would always want to have the hands on ability to resolve issues.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would maybe give up the more mundane tasks, like monitoring CPU and Memory and trying to restart services to free that up.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those monitoring and restart tasks the ones you’d want to hand off — what is it about them that you’re ready to let go of?

[USER]
They are frequent and boring. Freeing up disk space is also a mundane task, but the AI would need to know what files can be rotated.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, if a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I think a lot of tasks in my field can already be automated, but they aren't at the moment because we haven't got the specific tools to hand in our company. Were we to have them a lot of tasks that could resolve incidents could be automated. Going forward, I'm not sure what the future of my role would be if AI became advanced enough to make decisions about all of the issues that come into us on a day to day basis. I think we have a while to go before AI is capable enough to replace senior engineers - but they can definitely automate a lot more of our job, providing accuracy can be guaranteed.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what this looks like in practice — a recent situation where you decided how to approach an issue, and how you knew it should be you rather than a tool making the call?

[USER]
We currently have a CIFS mount issue where a job is running slowly. We can't isolate what is causing the issue, but AI has not provided me with an answer. Further troubleshooting such as doing a tcpdump and dtrace on the interface and executable needs to be done manually. AI could potentially do this in the future, but at the moment I had to talk to Red Hat to get that information.

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might hear what you just said. One is that it’s about choosing the approach and sequence of steps yourself. The other is that it’s about having the final say and carrying the responsibility for the outcome. Which of those fits better what you mean, or is it something else?

[USER]
I think it is more about choosing the approach to resolve the issue, but it is also about communicating with the customer. The customer describes a problem, but we don't have all of the information so have to go back and forth with the customer to try to gather more information. Could AI do this effectively? Maybe it could. At the moment I am at an impasse with this issue as I have gone back to the customer and asked for information and he hasn't got back to me.

[ASSISTANT]
In that CIFS case, what exactly did you ask the customer for, and how did you decide those were the next best pieces of information to request?

[USER]
I asked him for more details on how his job is slow and how long it has been slow. Whether this was the same in test as it was in production. He hasn't been specific about what job is running slowly. He says the job runs on his PC fast but on the server slowly. This could be some sort of mount point issue. I am still following this case up at the moment.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work right now or might affect it soon?

[USER]
Do you think that AI is guaranteed to be accurate enough for businesses to trust AI to carry out Systems Administration tasks as well as a person with 30 years experience?

[ASSISTANT]
Short answer: no, not guaranteed. Trust in these tools comes from tight scoping, guardrails, and verifiability, not from a blanket promise of accuracy.

In practice, businesses tend to trust AI for narrow, well-instrumented automations with low blast radius and clear rollback, such as:
- Detecting known patterns and proposing fixes tied to vetted runbooks
- Executing remediation behind approvals or in staged environments
- Handling routine maintenance with rate limits, audit trails, and health checks

What’s still hard to trust without human oversight are environment-specific diagnoses, ambiguous symptoms, or anything requiring trade-offs across performance, risk, and customer context. Getting to 30-year-expert reliability would require strong observability, policy constraints, sandboxed testing, explicit reasoning you can verify, and automatic rollback if KPIs degrade.

Is there anything else you’d like to add about how this is affecting your work right now?

[USER]
At the moment this isn't affecting my work as we haven't really utilised AI to a great extent, but I can see this changing as AI becomes more trustworthy across industry.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. Before we finish, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work now or could affect it soon?

[USER]
I wonder how AI can talk to the customer and offer a personal touch that humans can. I think that part is currently missing. The chatbots that banks use are often impersonal and not very useful.

[ASSISTANT]
That point about the personal touch comes through clearly. Is there anything else you’d like to add about AI’s impact on your work, or does this cover it for now?

[USER]
I think that covers everything from my side.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. Just to confirm, there’s nothing else you want to add about AI’s impact on your work?

Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

[USER]
I think it describes (3) how it might change my work but isn't at the moment. I feel that over the next few years we will see further developments in AI that will lead to advances in it's use in the workplace.#

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for the rating and for sharing your perspective. I appreciate your time and insights today. A7C9D2QF x7y8

Duration: 46.61 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm a software development manager

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
one that maintains good work life balance. Provides good development and advancement opportunities. Pays well.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say good work life balance, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
Work hours not super long - 8 hr per day is plenty enough. Also, a respect for workers' private time. Doesn't expect you to response to email or issues unless it's really really urgent.

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about development and advancement, what kinds of opportunities or support matter most to you?

[USER]
The opportunities to learn new technologies and new skills. The tech industry is moving very fast, so your skills can become obsolete very quickly if you don't learn continuously.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say it pays well, how do you judge that — is it about matching the market, reflecting your responsibilities, or something else?

[USER]
A bit of both.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use AI to summarize and draft memo and email. I also use it to brainstorm for ideas and solve problems. It's also a great learning tool. If I want to learn a new topic, I ask AI about it and it acts as my tutor.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last memo you drafted with it — what parts did it handle, and what parts did you do yourself?

[USER]
It was a memo on a client meeting. I gave it my meeting notes and asked it to draft a memo for my team. I made some changes to the memo it generated before sending it out.

[ASSISTANT]
What kinds of changes did you end up making to the draft before you sent it?

[USER]
It was nothing major. Mostly cosmetic - adjusting the tone a bit.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent time you used it to brainstorm a solution—what was the problem, and how did you and the tool divide the work?

[USER]
I was creating a development plan for one of my direct reports. I fed AI his resume and performance reviews, and asked it to come up with some ideas of career development that suited him.

[ASSISTANT]
In that development plan example, which of its suggestions did you end up keeping, and which did you set aside?

[USER]
The only one I set aside was attending a workshop of communication skills. I didn't have the budget for that.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about using it as a tutor, what’s the last topic you asked it to teach you, and what was that interaction like for you?

[USER]
I wanted to learn about vibe coding. So I asked it to give me an overview. Then I asked about the pros and cons, and the potential impact on my industry. It was like talking to an expert.

[ASSISTANT]
When you read the memo draft it produced, what went through your mind in that first pass?

[USER]
I don't remember. But generally I'm pretty satisfied with the AI's output.

[ASSISTANT]
Has it ever produced something that was off or wrong for your work, and if so, what happened next?

[USER]
Not at work. But for my personal use, yes.

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it for memos or planning, does it save you time, and if so, what do you usually do with that time?

[USER]
yeah I think it saves me time. But more importantly it reduces my cognitive load and hence fatigue. I never keep track of what I do with the time saved. I guess I spend it on things that AI can't do, like talking to my team, checking on with clients, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to before you used it, what stands out to you about how you now draft memos or development plans?

[USER]
These tasks are now less tiring and dreary. It's really wonderful to watch AI generating them in seconds what used to take me much longer.

[ASSISTANT]
When you review its drafts, what does that work feel like for you?

[USER]
At first it felt like Magic. I couldn't believe AI can actually do that. I'm old enough to remember AI based on expert systems. LLMs are light years ahead of that. But after a while, I just got used to this magic. I guess I've taken it for granted.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Not sure. I guess it improves them since I now spend a bit more time talking to my team.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent interaction with someone on your team that you think happened because you had a bit more time—what was the situation and how did it go?

[USER]
It's just the routine checkin with someone about what they are working on. Before, I'd just send them an email asking for updated. These days, I'm more likely walking over to their desk and chatting with them. It's good for relationship building.

[ASSISTANT]
Have you talked with your team about how they use it in their work, and what have you noticed in those conversations?

[USER]
Yeah. They all use AI for coding. The consensus is that it's somewhat useful but not quite there. AI's not very good with handling large context/codebase.

[ASSISTANT]
Has anything changed in how you interact with clients or what you share with them because you’re using these tools?

[USER]
Nothing significant that I can think of.

[USER]
hello??

[ASSISTANT]
In code reviews lately, what have you noticed about how these tools show up in the discussion?

[USER]
there's been some complains about it takes more time to debug the AI's code than to write it manually.

[ASSISTANT]
When you hear those complaints about debugging AI’s code, how do you respond as a manager?

[USER]
I said it wasn't mandatory to use AI. It was only a tool. If they didn't feel like the tool was useful, don't use it. Also, it's probably a good idea to limit the scope of the AI's work. Ask it to write a single function or debug a function. Don't ask it to generate an entire project.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
For my own interest, obviously I don't want to lose my job to AI. But if one day we got ASI and it could do my job perfectly, I guess it's going to take over no matter what.

[ASSISTANT]
Is there a specific part of your work you would still want to keep doing yourself, and why that part?

[USER]
Maybe the human interaction. I enjoy talking to people.

[ASSISTANT]
If a tool handled your one‑on‑ones or client chats for you, what do you think would change in your relationships or in how your team sees your role?

[USER]
In that case I probably would be out of a job.

[ASSISTANT]
What stands out to you about those conversations that you’d want to keep—what do they give you that a tool can’t?

[USER]
they convey information beyond verbal communication. There's facial expression, body language, tone, etc. AI can't capture that. not yet.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
mostly the admin task. email, memo, performance plan, etc

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
that you get to decide how to do your job

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of a recent day when you really felt you got to decide how to do your job, and what that looked like in practice?

[USER]
I felt my team was getting worn down. So I decided to do a 1 day offsite to recharge. I'm glad I have the autonomy to do that.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say you get to decide how to do your job, do you mean choosing the methods and tools day to day, or setting the priorities and trade‑offs for the team, or is it something else altogether?

[USER]
yeah that too.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent time when you couldn’t decide the approach you wanted, and what changed in your day because of that?

[USER]
we use pretty standard project management methodology. So we just follow that approach.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how these tools are changing your work?

[USER]
I think we covered it all.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Interview 106

Date: 12/12/2025 18:21:21
Duration: 33.96 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a senior data manager for a health related study at a university in the UK. thank you for having me

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Flexibility in terms of working from home and going to the office, having varied tasks, the ability to progress, having a solid team, working with people who are competent at what they do but also who are good people. Also working in meaningful for for society

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about flexibility, what does that look like in practice for you, say in a recent week?

[USER]
For example, last week I was not feeling too motivated to go in and the weather was not great, so I chose to stay home and work. Other weeks if I felt like it I would go in every day, or go in half days in the office or other at home. I think that is important

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned meaningful for society. Can you tell me about a time recently when your work felt meaningful, and what about it gave you that sense?

[USER]
In one of our interviews the participant said that the interview did really well for them and that they felt heard and they had not felt like that in years. Through this study we are able to directly impact the life of people, through data that drives policy but also sometimes in direct experiences like this one, where we had a connection and the participant was moved and felt helped by what we were doing

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a solid team, can you tell me about a moment that showed you your team has that quality?

[USER]
We had a period of ups and downs in the team, where we were shortstaffed because of illness and maternity leave, which obviously is normal. Those who were still working motivated each other and helped each other out so we could cover and still manage to accomplish what we needed to. And I think that is important because it shows that genuinely I am working with good people but that they are also very competent

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
As a senior data manager I use AI on a day to day basis to complement a lot of the tasks that I do, such as scripts for data cleaning, database building

[ASSISTANT]
In the case of writing scripts for data cleaning or building a database, can you walk me through one recent task and say which parts you did yourself and which parts the AI handled?

[USER]
I mean for example I was working on multiple sql scripts that would help me migrate tables from REDCap databases into a microsoft access environment. I would say that I did it all, but whenever I was unsure of a query or wanted a suggestion, AI would complement what I was doing, as in I would prompt it and then it would help me, but I am experienced in SQL and in both MS Access and REDCap so that is why I feel that for me  I was doing almost all of it and only using AI as a complement tool

[ASSISTANT]
In that SQL migration case, did it ever give you something that didn’t work, and what did you do next?

[USER]
Yeah absolutely, many many times actually. I kept prompting it over and over, rephrasing the question, or even copy pastying what the error was to see if that would make a difference

[ASSISTANT]
When it kept giving you things that didn’t work, what went through your mind in those moments?

[USER]
I guess I was a bit frustrated, but at the same time I wondered whether I had not been clear enough, or if there was anything I could add to make it actually work

[ASSISTANT]
When it does give you a usable query, how do you check it before you run it on your data?

[USER]
I have a test environment, both in REDCap and a separate MS Access instance so I would always run queries on test environments first

[ASSISTANT]
When it does help, what difference does it make to your time or the way you organize the task?

[USER]
It helps tremendously in terms of time because it would probably take me much longer to figure it out without it. And it helps organize because I am essentially having a conversation about what I am doing, which helps me organize things but also learn about what I am doing

[ASSISTANT]
How does using AI affect your confidence in the final result?

[USER]
I don't think it has a direct impact, I would be confident with AI or not. I choose to use it because we should be embracing technology and using it to complement what we do. But whether I use it or not is independent of my confidence. Confidence comes with experience and from learning. Confidence comes from putting effort into things.

[ASSISTANT]
When you save that time, what do you usually put it toward?

[USER]
Other tasks I might have, say admin, or other tickets, or data cleaning

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Pretty neutral to be honest, AI is something that I used on an individual level to complement my work, I have not really used it in collaborations or in ways that it would affect my working relationships if that makes sense. Its completely independent, until I am in a project where I am producing something with someone and use some AI, but at this point in time since I am working on databases and data and use AI to complement, its separate to my working relationships

[ASSISTANT]
Have you talked with your colleagues or your manager about using it, and if so what were those conversations like?

[USER]
Absolutely, even with my manager. I think with my colleagues its more of a joke as we all use it but not to do everything again its more of a tool on the side. With our manager we actually talked about generating images and how our institution embraces it and we even have paid accounts so, conversations are happening for sure!

[ASSISTANT]
Has using it changed what your manager or teammates expect from you in terms of speed or the kinds of tasks you take on?

[USER]
Not at all, because at this point of time it is up to us whether we use it or not. They don't know what is AI and what isn't. We don't go into detail, as long as things are done and its about quality that is all that matters

[ASSISTANT]
Have you had any moments where using it sparked a misunderstanding or where you had to explain your process to someone?

[USER]
There was one time where I used to complement/help me write some of the code for ICC analysis, and I guess with AI we went one specific way, but we had not considered another factor so the person just wondered whether we could include that. But again, by prompting AI and also understand the needs of the researcher a little better and having a back and forth, we were able to amend the script and get it to do what it needed to do.

[ASSISTANT]
In that back and forth with the researcher, what stood out to you about how the interaction went compared with similar work before these tools were around?

[USER]
The researcher didn't know that AI was used to complement the code and shape it, so honestly it was the same

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Look, in health data there are a lot of confidential and personal identifable information that does not belong in anyones hands other than the person or whoever has control and permission of the data through consent. So honestly anything considered serious special category data or sensitive data.

[ASSISTANT]
I hear you. What is it about keeping that work in your own hands that matters most to you, beyond meeting the formal rules?

[USER]
Well its all about integrity with our participants, but also a sense that this is a human study, we are human and we should be in charge, not the computers. Sure, AI and computers can complement us, but we should be leading it as professionals but also as people

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over handling that kind of sensitive work, how do you think it would change your role or your relationships with participants and teammates?

[USER]
I think it would create some tension in the sense that people would not trust it no matter how perfect it is because LLMs and AI are still programmed

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Probably more admin-tasks that have no sensitive data, for example running vlookups on spreadsheets or when people ask you to generate a dataset from anynymous variables, I think that would be good, again humans need to QC it and I dictate when its done but yeah that would save time

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up that kind of admin task?

[USER]
They are boring, repetitive, and it would allow me to focus on other more important tasks

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those admin pieces, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
Not at all, because some times those tasks are already given to say people doing placements or more junior, so if anything they would see that I am more focused and involved in bigger, more important things

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
For me it is to have flexibility, trust in what you do, to prioritise quality over quality, to work at your own pace and meeting deadlines, to be able to lead and learn and contribute

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from a recent project that shows what that looks like in practice?

[USER]
I am working on a new data dictionary but obviously its a massive undertaking since we are in the middle of a data collection phase and the study is decades old. I work on it when I can, and prioritise it, like building blocks, little by little. Without affecting my other tasks, I have been able to work on that big project over time and now it is at a very good place, so I think that shows that. Being able to manage your own tasks and manage your own time.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say trust in what you do, can you tell me about a moment where that trust was really visible day to day?

[USER]
I build some pretty robust databases for the current data collection phase. Lots of testing and working with my users. And I think a couple years it shows, we put in a lot of work for those databases to be at a good place, and now the data is being collected and it comes in and its pretty straightforward because the structure and foundations are in place.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about that data dictionary project, did you use any AI in that work, and if so what parts did it help with and what stayed firmly in your hands?

[USER]
For the data dictionary it just helped me put things in a nicer format, because I was moving things from really old HTML tables into Excel, so I would feed it HTML and it would help format things like that. But then obviously things like variable names and making decisions stayed with me, as I know our study and the data in detail and that comes with experience

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t touched on?

[USER]
AI is at a good place and it will continue to be everywhere. We need to embrace it and let it complement what we do. Change is good, we are living different times and its good to just embrace the change and ride the wave.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
In a positive way, complementing what I do, allowing me to learn and grow

[ASSISTANT]
Is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work, or does that cover it for you?

[USER]
That covers it for me, thank you

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

[USER]

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing your experiences and reflections today. I appreciate the thoughtfulness and clarity you brought to the conversation. If anything else comes to mind later, I’d be glad to hear it.

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work as a Software Engineer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
There are several things we would need to consider
a) Your manager and your team. If all of these are good 85% of your job is great
b) Mentorship. Especially from those who are junior or intermediate levels. It makes a difference.
c) Being paid fairly. Wage theft is just wrong, and underpaying people to appease capitalism is very much wrong
d) Depending on the company, leadership needs to have a sane head on their shoulders

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a good manager and team make most of the difference, what does that look like in your day to day?

[USER]
Open communication, servant-leader mindset, personally mine is humble enough to tell me "if you aren't comfortable telling me or the issue is me, you are more than welcome to DM [director's name]" and my director is also great!

[ASSISTANT]
When mentorship is working well, what does it look like in practice for you?

[USER]
Tells me what I need to improve upon, doesn't do my work for me, but tells me what I need to know, encourages me, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
When leadership has a sane head on their shoulders, what stands out to you in how they make decisions that affect your team?

[USER]
Well I am moving teams sooooo, it would be fulfilling the best interests of the rank-and-file, not their own pockets.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
That depends, are we talking how I use it day-to-day, or how it's a huge catalyst that generated a lot of bureaucratical nightmares?

[ASSISTANT]
Let’s start with the one that feels more significant to you. Could you walk me through a recent example?

[USER]
For sure. So 3-4 reorgs in a month, first it was contractor reductions, second it was denying backfills causing entire release trains to trade devs around, third it was now to have AI-dedicated teams, and now it's consolidation of team management to lower managers and eliminating other management positions

[ASSISTANT]
During those reorgs, what changed in what you personally were doing each day?

[USER]
Since it's the holiday season, it burnt the hell out of me out.

[ASSISTANT]
What did a typical day look like for you during that stretch?

[USER]
A slog, real slow. can't think. Just weather the storm until my team transition.

[ASSISTANT]
1y4x

[USER]
This is the code correct?

[ASSISTANT]
Yes. 

Shifting back to your work, can you tell me about a specific task you did recently where you brought an AI tool into your workflow?

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work as a Database Platform Manager, it’s probably 60% technical with 40% managerial \ project management kind of thing

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Well, I think dedication, focus, enthusiasm and a solid work ethic are key for success personally. I’m of the view that specific skills can be taught as long as the person has the right mindset and desire to learn.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think of a good job, what about the job itself makes it good?

[USER]
Good conditions - pay, benefits, working from home - of course they’re core. However, it’s the people you work with that really make a difference. I’ll also add that a good job is rewarding and satisfying, and should leave you feeling fulfilled at the end of the day.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say the people make the difference, what qualities in colleagues or managers matter most to you?

[USER]
I think from a manager, they need to be fair, transparent and good at communicating. That probably goes for colleagues too, but I’d be looking for that sense of camaraderie as well with my peers. People I can get along with, maybe even a social aspect to it

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent day that left you feeling fulfilled at work?

[USER]
Sure, earlier this week I was approached by a business user about a slow Power App they were using. We did some fault-finding and I redesigned the database - carefully of course - and the app using it started working much more efficiently. I got to see a problem through end to end, I delivered a quality result and left a team of fee earners really delighted.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
Positively! I use Copilot for things like meeting notes, which helps distil and crystallise outputs. I also use that, and ChatGPT, for things like code reviews, wording for comms and reports. A lot of the administrative stuff is easier and quicker for me by several orders of magnitude, as opposed to not using AI

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about your last meeting where you used Copilot for notes, what did it produce, and what did you add or change yourself?

[USER]
I got a meeting summary with action points attributed to each attendee. I changed only some wording where I didn’t feel the gist of what was said had quite been captured.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent time you used ChatGPT for a code review? What did it flag, and what did you end up doing with that feedback?

[USER]
I had a really inefficient query that contained a lot of inline CTEs. I knew it was bad, I wanted suggestions on how to improve it for different use cases. I changed some details and pasted it in, took the outputs and tested them against a development copy of a database. I did have to change a bit of the revised query I was given, but again I was able to use my own thinking and knowledge whilst not doing the “donkey work”

[ASSISTANT]
In that code review case, did the AI get anything clearly wrong, and if so, how did you handle it?

[USER]
Not wrong, more like not considering other factors / upstream and downstream processes. This was because I had omitted certain information (deliberately) so my edits really were more related to business logic than poor code.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were using it for that query rewrite, what went through your mind about how much to trust its suggestions versus your own judgment?

[USER]
In general, I assume a default position of distrust towards AI outputs. I thought in this case the code looked good and the reasons given were logical and cogent, but I was always going to test it in a non-production environment anyway. I wouldn’t just copy and paste code generated by AI straight into a production server.

[ASSISTANT]
When those tools shave time off your day, what do you end up doing with that time?

[USER]
Other work - in Agile terms, my velocity increases, so I can spend more time on work which requires thought and my personal touch (architecture diagrams and proposals for example, though I would still use AI for some of the wording!)

[ASSISTANT]
When you use AI to help with wording in comms or reports, what does that process look like for you from first draft to sending it out?

[USER]
I’ll type something up, ask for it to be polished using my writing style and previous inputs as a basis for that revision. I might go through a couple of versions, tweak an output a bit before sending - but I know my wording will be precise and well understood, and the tone will be consistent and correct for my intended audience

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re working with these tools on a tricky task, what emotions or gut reactions tend to come up for you?

[USER]
Probably a bit of relief that I have a helper! Curiousity too - I wonder how the output will look, and sometimes I even wonder if the task is just too much for it.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time when using one of these tools created extra work or confusion, and how you handled it?

[USER]
There are very few examples I can think of, but I used a meeting transcript as a basis to draft some comms, didn’t check the output and just copy-pasted before sending. It caused some confusion for the recipients as what I’d said (or rather, what the AI had output) wasn’t quite right and wasn’t what was agreed in the call.

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized the comms had caused confusion, what did you do next, and what stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
I felt like a bit of a fool, apologised for the error and corrected it. What stands out to me is that outputs should be checked for accuracy!

[ASSISTANT]
How do you decide which tasks you bring these tools into, and which you keep strictly manual?

[USER]
Whether or not it needs my absolute personal touch. Things like appraisal \ performance feedback are great examples. Other examples might relate to production code, I won’t feed that directly to an AI (unmodified) and anything related to company confidential, highly specific matters.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
With my colleagues? I don’t think it has hugely. I have seen some people blatantly using AI outputs to email me (the double hyphen and tone is always a dead giveaway) and I’ve seen dreadful code that looks like AI to me. That frustrates me and I will call it out.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent time you called it out—what did you say, and how did the other person respond?

[USER]
I refused to implement a change because the code was AI, I raised a concern that someone had input confidential company data into a public AI and that no human review or skill had gone into it.

[ASSISTANT]
How did the colleague respond when you refused, and what happened next?

[USER]
Well they admitted as I suspected and we reviewed the code, made some changes and implemented it. I didn’t go in too hard on them, we talked about safe use of AI in line with policy.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Interviewing people, probably architecture and system design. I need to be able to put my name to something, and whilst I may use AI assistance, the ultimate output is my responsibility.

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about interviewing people that you want to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
The whole lot! I don’t think AI can replicate human “gut instincts” when selecting candidates and making hiring decisions

[ASSISTANT]
What about architecture and system design do you want to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
The final sign-off, I don’t care who produces the diagrams. I care about the reasoning and the understanding of the business problem, translating that accurately into a technical solution when sometimes, there are unspoken or implied requirements.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Reporting and responding to low-level alerts. They are repeatable, tedious and don’t need a human to deal with them.

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up reporting and responding to low-level alerts?

[USER]
Because the AI can do it so much more quickly than I could - the reporting side - and getting it wrong if it has access to the data I want reporting on would be hard! Alerts, well, a simple process workflow could be easy to implement.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those reports and low level alerts, how do you think it might change how others see your contribution on the team?

[USER]
I’d hope they would see the value add I bring in other areas, with the extra time I’d have

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Freedom to take risks and work in your own way, notwithstanding policies and security requirements.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice?

[USER]
Being able to choose and download my own tools, use them to complete my work, without being constrained or blocked.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent time you had that kind of freedom—what tool or approach did you choose, and what difference did it make to the outcome?

[USER]
I went out and bought a monitoring tool as what we had wasn’t fit for purpose. It made a huge, positive difference for comparatively little cost to the business

[ASSISTANT]
When you decided to buy that monitoring tool, how did you handle approval or risk—what steps did you take to make it acceptable in your organization?

[USER]
I had to get budget approval, I did a presentation on the tool where I extolled the benefits, and made it so compelling by virtue of my business justification

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might understand what you said — that it means choosing your own methods and tools, or that it means deciding which problems to tackle and on what timeline. Which of those fits better for you, or do you mean something else?

[USER]
Actually a bit of both, but more the former than the latter

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else about how AI is affecting your work that you think we haven’t covered?

[USER]
Only to say that AI for my employer is taking off massively. It will truly change the way we do business, but I worry we are in a bit of a “bubble” with AI and have concerns over that.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of this. Your point about the “bubble” and the pace of rollout really stands out. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work before we close?

[USER]
No, I think we’ve covered everything.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hello, I work in IT industry as a business analyst and SQL developer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
tasks in this job are talking to the business (client) who want to have created data warehouse for their insurance data. So I am discussing with them to know what they want, analyzing their data and then discussing with the developers what we need to get done

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks, that helps me picture your role. Thinking more generally, what makes a job good in your eyes?

[USER]
in my eyes what makes this job good are 1. contact with people with different professional bacgrounds, 2. improving analytical skills, 3. constant learning

[ASSISTANT]
Of those three, which feels most important to you right now, and what makes it stand out?

[USER]
actually I didn't mention one more - this work is fully remote. What makes it stand out I believe is just that

[ASSISTANT]
What about being fully remote makes the job good for you?

[USER]
It cuts a lot of my cost - I don't need to have car to go to work, I am saving commute time, I can do home related time when work is slower

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI helps a lot with my work. there are few main aspects. One is when I need to send a formal email, I am asking AI to fix any errors or suggest changes. Next it helps me verify SQL code when developers are asking for debugging. I also can ask it to summarize meeting transcript or validate data set

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about the SQL debugging you mentioned, can you walk me through the last time you used AI on a query — what it did and what you did?

[USER]
yeah, so lets say there is a sql stored procedure which was throwing an error. I copy pasted it to the chat and asked it to look for possible errors

[ASSISTANT]
What did it point out or suggest, and what did you do with that suggestion?

[USER]
I recall some misstypes in code, other time it was missing ',' character. I corrected it in code per AI suggestion and then it worked well. Sometimes I am asking it for basic queries for update data etc

[ASSISTANT]
When you look over the AI’s suggestions on code, what goes through your mind as you decide what to accept and what to ignore?

[USER]
I used to be a developer too, so I would say my experience allows me to distinguish what to choose. I am using AI more like helper and to save time instead of going through hundreds of lines

[ASSISTANT]
Has there been a time when its suggestion on a query was off, and how did you handle that in the moment?

[USER]
Yes many times. Each system is a little different and AI doesn't know the whole picture, for an example relations between different tables. I didn't try to teach AI when query was off, I was then fixing it myself

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it to polish a formal email, what does it usually change, and what do you tend to keep as-is?

[USER]
I am not English native, so I know I tend to make mistakes. Cost common are missing characters like ',' I am pasting my email and then asking ai write it in corrected form

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the last time you asked it to summarize a meeting transcript—what did you need from the summary, and how did you use it afterward?

[USER]
We have daily meetings very often project manager is assigning different tasks to different people. I like to paste meeting transcript and ask chat to throw bulletpoint list with who should do which task

[ASSISTANT]
When you ask it to validate a data set, what exactly do you ask it to check, and what do you do with the output?

[USER]
I am asking to look for errors in data - it is insurance related, so I am asking for these. Some examples are missing policy number, negative premium amount etc

[ASSISTANT]
When it flags an issue in the data, what’s your gut response—do you tend to trust it right away or do you find yourself double‑checking, and why?

[USER]
I am always double checking to make sure it is real data error. And if it is a real data error then I need to report it to the client and ask them to fix the issue

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re using these tools in the middle of a busy day, what stands out about how it feels to work that way?

[USER]
the whole point of doing it is to make day less busy, AI allows me to save time and look more professional in contact with the client. I believe it makes me better looking employee

[ASSISTANT]
When you save time this way, what do you usually end up doing with that time?

[USER]
usually I am ending up doing more work, which prevents work to pile up closer to the deadline

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It didn't affect my working relationships, I am not open about using AI. Some team leads are sceptical with people using it, so it isn't the best idea to share it

[ASSISTANT]
Keeping it to yourself, has that changed how you collaborate or ask for help on tasks?

[USER]
I don't think so. Most of the time I am the one asked for help, because industry is very specific and final decisions are made by the client. when I am talking to them it is often by the email, in which AI helps

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned some team leads are skeptical. Can you tell me about a moment that made you decide it’s better not to mention using it?

[USER]
As I mentioned we have daily team meetings. Once someone mentioned they are using AI and leader's responses were very negative about it, that made me not mentioning it

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
For sure I wouldn't pass client's production data into AI for any validation due to security concerns

[ASSISTANT]
What makes keeping that work in your own hands important to you, rather than routing production data through a tool?

[USER]
insurance companies have strict policies about sharing data they gathered, It can't go out of the organization's environment. That would be violation of their policy

[ASSISTANT]
If there were a secure tool hosted entirely inside the insurer’s environment, would that change anything about using it with production data?

[USER]
only if they would allow it

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
besides what I am already giving. I can thing of one item, We have many different experts in our organization and some specific problems need a meetings to be solved. These people have other projects and meetings during the day. Would be nice if I could ask AI to find a time frame for xyz day when all people I need to meet with have open window

[ASSISTANT]
What makes handing off that scheduling work appealing to you?

[USER]
If I need to meet with 5 people at once (very usual) I need to look at each one's calendar, ask, etc

[USER]
AI could do it for me

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled that scheduling, would it change how others see your contribution on the project?

[USER]
I don't think so, for me it is a smart use of resource to save time and be able to give it for more meaningful tasks

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I think this comes with the experience. Someone needs to put a lot of effort in to both technical side like coding part, then interpersonal to talk with professionals, and there is also industry knowing part

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of a recent situation where your experience let you decide how to handle a tricky client request, and what you chose to do?

[USER]
so final part of the job is UAT, where our client is looking at their data in power BI reports we created. One of the report is called claims balancing. They found a mismatch in premium gross incurred. After talking to them I found out their definition of gross incurred calculation is different that the one commonly used in the industry. I had to have a meeting to convince them to change their view on it

[ASSISTANT]
In that meeting, what did you draw on to make your case—data, standards, examples—and how did you decide that was the right way to approach them?

[USER]
we had 2 options. 1. convince them or 2. change all reports to their definition. option 2 would affect timelines of ending project so I had to make option 1 work. I have them all calculation I could. I created a spreadsheet with all base measures in our reports and had them to get familiar with it and approve

[ASSISTANT]
On a normal week, what kinds of decisions do you make on your own, and which ones do you bring to the client or a manager?

[USER]
When change isn't making difference to the report I am making these decisions myself. If change will reflect report then client needs to approve it

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
I think I gave all I could

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers!

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work in a small IT department at a company that mostly does sales.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
good pay, good benefits, good coworkers and understanding upper management

[ASSISTANT]
When you say understanding upper management, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
Management that understands how long things take to do and don't make unrealistic demands and learn to delegate to their workers that are experts in their fields.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think of good coworkers, what do they do or not do that makes your day go better?

[USER]
I think that good coworkers are those that know how to communicate and are able to work together with others to help finish projects faster.

[ASSISTANT]
Which of those feels most important to you right now, and why?

[USER]
People that know how to cooperate with each other because it makes work more enjoyable and allows you to complete things faster.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I don't think that AI impacts my work a lot since we mainly do IT for the office we mainly deal with hardware problems.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you interacted with any AI at work, if at all?

[USER]
We implemented a support ticket system and it does have a chatbot that asks simple questions to form a more detailed support ticket.

[ASSISTANT]
In that setup, what does the chatbot handle and what parts do you or your team handle after it creates the ticket?

[USER]
It handles the creation of the ticket and asking the person submitting the ticket clarifying questions to try to get more information so that it is easier for us to troubleshoot.

[ASSISTANT]
When you first started using it, what stood out to you about the quality of the information it collected on those tickets?

[USER]
What stood out is that we got more information about the problem that helped us troubleshoot a lot more.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through one recent ticket where those extra details changed what you did first?

[USER]
one of the tickets said that the monitor wasn't working because of the extra details that said that their was graphical anomalies on the screen first before going black we first checked the graphics card instead of focusing on the monitor

[ASSISTANT]
Has the chatbot ever gathered info that turned out to be off or misleading, and if so, what did you do next?

[USER]
No, it hasn't happened because it mainly just asks simple questions to the person to get more details.

[ASSISTANT]
In that moment when the extra details pointed you to the graphics card first, what went through your mind?

[USER]
That it would be easy to just change out the card and see if that fixed it so it wouldn't take a lot of time.

[ASSISTANT]
When it saved you time on a ticket like that, what did you end up doing with that time?

[USER]
I ended up being able to answer more support tickets and finish my work faster.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to before the chatbot, how does your workflow on a typical day feel different, if at all?

[USER]
It feels different because we don't have to go find the person who submitted the ticket and ask what the problem with the system is because before they would basically just say it wasn't working.

[ASSISTANT]
Besides the ticket chatbot, has anything else using AI touched your work?

[USER]
No, there isn't really anything else that involves AI in my work right now.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It hasn't because we don't really use AI to interact with each other.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
No I am open to anything if it makes my job a lot easier.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you open to handing things over in that way? What’s the thinking behind that for you?

[USER]
I think that it is inevitable since work places will want to implement AI technologies to bring down costs.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI started handling more of your daily tasks, how do you think that would change your role on the team?

[USER]
I don't think it would change my role on the team it would more so just change the tasks that I focus on.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Answering support tickets or having to deal with clients and walking them through troubleshooting.

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up that part of the job?

[USER]
Because it is the part of the job that I dislike because I don't enjoy dealing with angry people that demand that you solve their problem quickly.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled that first line with clients, how do you think it would change how clients interact with you or how your teammates rely on you?

[USER]
I think that the clients would just share the details of their problem since they would know that it is useless to get angry with an AI system. Though it wouldn't change how my teammates rely on me.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I think that in IT autonomy means having the trust that you can diagnose problems, choose solutions, and manage your workload without constant oversight.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your own job of what that looks like in practice?

[USER]
In my own job its just the fact that I get in to work and am able to follow my own schedule and am able to work at my own pace as long as I finish what I have to do.

[ASSISTANT]
When something unexpected comes in, like a rush of tickets, how do you decide what to tackle first without someone directing you?

[USER]
I quickly skim the tickets and see which ones I can finish quickly and prioritize those and make a rough list that I go through.

[USER]
?

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
No, I don't have anything else to say.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm a software engineer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
For me a good job has to give me enough work and life balance, friendly and relaxed environment and opportunities to grow

[ASSISTANT]
When you say work and life balance, what does that look like in your day to day?

[USER]
It means no work very long hours in a day, so work my  scheduled hours, don’t get out of work calls

[ASSISTANT]
When you picture a friendly and relaxed environment, what kinds of interactions or moments tell you it’s really like that?

[USER]
Having friendly colleagues, so I don’t feel bad when needing to go to the office. Have social events not work related and that don’t feel an obligation

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about opportunities to grow, what kinds of skills or responsibilities are you hoping to develop?

[USER]
leadership skills, being put on projects or tasks that allow me challenge myself and help me move up in my role

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI has been very helpful in my work as it can quickly answer any questions code related. It also help me find bugs in my code and prevent bugs

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it to find a bug—what was the situation and what did you do with it step by step?

[USER]
I recently started coding in golang so I was creating a message hub and I used AI to design the structure of my application and I also shared my code with the AI to find what could be improved and fixed

[ASSISTANT]
In that message hub example, which parts did you create yourself, and which parts came from the AI’s suggestions?

[USER]
All code was created by me, the AI only suggested how to  structure my code. Other suggestions from the AI were code corrections like duplications or functionality

[ASSISTANT]
Did it ever give you a suggestion you decided not to follow, or something you considered wrong, and how did you handle that in the moment?

[USER]
Yes it sometimes suggests too advanced concepts that I decided not to use as I didn’t understand and they were more complex than my level. I asked it for other suggestions and concepts I could learn to implement instead

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when it proposed those more advanced concepts?

[USER]
That I could just copy and paste them and use them but I wouldn’t be able to explain my code and understand what was really happening

[ASSISTANT]
How did using it on that project change the time it took you to get from first draft to something you were comfortable shipping?

[USER]
It made me work faster and reduced the usual time I take to figure out where to start and what structure to go for

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re checking its suggestions against your own judgment, what is that experience like for you?

[USER]
It was good as I asked it to explain what was the differences and why one approach was better than another

[ASSISTANT]
When you were reviewing its suggestions and sometimes pushing back, what stands out to you about that experience?

[USER]
The AI was friendly and wouldn’t push me to use its suggestions what was helpful

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that project?

[USER]
I was able to read more about the new coding language and learn different things about it. I was also able to work on other small tickets at same time

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It didn’t affect anything, as it’s something we all use sometimes at work

[ASSISTANT]
Have you and your teammates talked about any norms or boundaries for using AI at work? For example, what’s considered okay to use it for and what isn’t?

[USER]
The company as provided its own AI so it respects all norms or boundaries. So it has it own limits already

[ASSISTANT]
In collaborative work like code reviews or pairing, has using AI changed how you and your colleagues discuss or divide tasks?

[USER]
No,  we  still do the code reviews or pairing without any AI

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Im not sure, AI is helpful but I also don’t want it to do all work I do

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about the parts of your job that feel most “yours,” which specific task would you want to keep doing yourself, and why?

[USER]
The coding bit. Coding is all that made me getting into software development I like do build things

[ASSISTANT]
What is important to you about writing the code yourself rather than guiding an AI to generate it?

[USER]
Knowing that I build it and I was the one creating it and seeing it being used by others

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI did most of the coding, how do you think that would change your role on the team or how others see what you contribute?

[USER]
I think my job wouldn’t be needed or at least as many developers in a team.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
The code and project planing

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you want to hand over the code and project planning to AI—what would be better for you if AI handled those?

[USER]
Because it’s the part of the work I least enjoy

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned wanting to keep coding, and now you’d give the code to AI. Can you help me understand what part you’d keep and what part you’d hand over?

[USER]
When I say code planning I mean the process of choosing what language and software to use and not the actual coding process

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled that upfront planning, how do you think it would change how others see your contribution on the team?

[USER]
It would reduce  the process time as it would cut on the try and error bit. My contribution would still be the same I believe

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
It means being able to choose my tasks and working on them in my own pass without constantly being pressured. It’s also the possibility to choose from where I can work.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of a recent time when you got to choose your tasks and set your own pace—what happened and how did it play out?

[USER]
In my current job I’m able to pick my tickets what makes me work faster as I don’t have to wait to be assigned to things and I can go as I finish. This results in me choosing tickets I’m comfortable with and work faster

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about it, do you mean more having the say over which pieces of work you take on, or more deciding how to approach and sequence the work you’re given? Which fits better for you?

[USER]
More on deciding how to approach and sequence the work

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t touched on?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

[USER]
3

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing your experiences and perspectives today. I appreciate the clarity and examples you offered, and I’ve noted your rating of 3. Wishing you the best with your Go projects and learning journey. Confirmation code: Q7P3L9MA x7y8

Duration: 66.69 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am currently a software engineer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Resolving bugs in a quick and timely manner, assisting customer support, meeting sprint goals

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks. Thinking more generally, beyond those specific tasks, what makes a job good in your eyes?

[USER]
Being knowledge about the product and being about to mentor or assist with a wide variety of questions

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about a really good week at work, what stands out about it for you?

[USER]
Resolving a massive client issue, finishing a difficult ticket or clearing out my queue and being able to come in the next day to pick up tasks always feels good

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about those moments that makes them satisfying for you?

[USER]
It's the satisfaction of knowing that I've finished something difficult, or have a clean slate to pick my next adventure

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It's constantly being thrown down my throat. It's not necessarily improving my work ethic. It helps for certain things like writing documentation or quick SQL scripts but my main job requires me to think rather than code. So when I attempt to use AI there is a lot of back and forth with it that may end take longer than me actually attempting to conceptualize something alone.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used it to write a quick SQL script? What was the task and how did it go?

[USER]
I asked it take look at the format of two tables that I needed to join to filter a specific type of row out. It was able to quickly provide a script to me within 10 seconds of me sending my prompt

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the script once you got it?

[USER]
I ran it in the DB, it was not a CRUD action. Just a query

[ASSISTANT]
Did the query give you what you needed, and how did you check that the results were right?

[USER]
It did give me what I needed. I asked AI to write the script because I was being lazy but I knew roughly what I wanted

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it for documentation, what parts do you let it draft, and what do you usually add or change yourself?

[USER]
I let it write the entire documentation but correct it as I check over the documents. It is a collaborative experience.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent time you tried using it on one of those thinking-heavy tasks and ended up in that back and forth? What were you trying to figure out, and what happened step by step?

[USER]
I asked it a question about an error that I was seeing in the UI for our application. I provided it with the error and the class that it more than likely originated from. It then began to hallucinate methods and properties that did not exist to explain the issue to me.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do next to get to the bottom of the issue after you saw it inventing methods?

[USER]
I tried to correct it by stating that it was making up things. But it continued to hallucinate throughout the process. 20 minutes later, I manually debugged the issue myself

[ASSISTANT]
When it kept making things up, what went through your mind, and how did you react in the moment?

[USER]
I got angry and I'm ashamed to admit, I cursed at it in the chat. I'm company is spending millions on this software because "everyone else is" but in my day-to-day it does not help much.

[ASSISTANT]
On the days when it helps with docs or quick queries, what do you do with the time it frees up?

[USER]
I'm able to focus on more tasks, do more debugging, more coding, or answer questions of the juniors on my team.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It's made the juniors less likely to reach out for help, and has kind of reduced collaboration

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent moment when a junior used it instead of reaching out to you? What happened step by step?

[USER]
A junior we hired recently wrote a new feature to filter record in the UI - something simple that can be mocked up honestly with the built in tools in visual studio. They wrote it all with AI and it came out as jumbled code. Unnecessary, variables, overly complicated conditional statements and lots of them. Needless to say I rejected the PR and sat with them to work on the task

[ASSISTANT]
In that code review with the junior, what stood out to you about the conversation itself?

[USER]
The junior did not know the basics of coding, names or concepts in software engineering.

[ASSISTANT]
How did realizing that change how you approached mentoring them or setting expectations for their next attempt?

[USER]
I realized that I will need to reach out more to them in order to help along. They require more oversight

[ASSISTANT]
Has it changed what your manager expects from you in terms of speed or volume of work?

[USER]
My manager understands my frustration because they also have tried using it. It can be helpful for certain things but they find themself in the same situation as me

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I ideally would love to hand over large portions of my job to AI but right now it's just not ready for cognitive work. Just busy work that requires repetition or writing.

[ASSISTANT]
Even if an AI could truly handle it flawlessly, is there any part of your work you would still want to keep for yourself? Which part comes to mind and why?

[USER]
I like the debugging aspect of my job. I would like to keep that.

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about debugging that you want to keep — what makes that part meaningful or enjoyable for you?

[USER]
It's like hunting, tracking your prey. You know what it looks like, where it lives. You just need to catch a glimpse of it

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent bug hunt that sticks in your mind — what the trail looked like and the moment you finally “caught” it?

[USER]
We had an intermediate issue where a client would see records of IDs different to the person that they were running an API call for. Our API calls are all SOAP action, so the client sends a list of parameters to query. What the client was doing was sending an update initially to the records and querying afterwords. They wrote this in their internal tools. I had an idea of this because it was the only way that this could occur logically. I was able to catch it on a call with their devs.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I'd love to give the ticket creation part of my job to AI yesterday

[ASSISTANT]
What makes ticket creation the thing you’d hand off — what about that work makes you want AI to take it?

[USER]
It's monotonous, and boring.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled ticket creation, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
No, because no one wants to do that aspect either

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
In order to have autonomy, you need to understand how to work through problems. It's not able having the solution. You need to be able to be thrown into a situation where you are clueless and be able to work your way through it, logically.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example of a time when you were thrown into something you didn’t understand and worked your way through it step by step? What did that look like in practice?

[USER]
I did not know how to build jmeter automated tests. i was given a project to build a proof of concept. I had the project manager provide a list of must haves and stretch goals. I set expectations that It would take time to learn how to build tests. I started with small ones getting used to the process, then started to interlink our systems in tests and progressed slowly until I was able to build something that met requirements.

[ASSISTANT]
If that young person asked how they’d recognize they have it on a given day, what concrete signs or moments would tell them they do?

[USER]
They break the problem down and work through it in pieces without direction

[ASSISTANT]
When you use tools or advice from others, is the key thing being able to choose your own approach, or is it owning the outcome even if you bring in outside input, or is it something else altogether?

[USER]
owning the outcome, because at the end of the day you choose whether or not to accept input from others.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI has impacted your work?

[USER]
Nothing that comes to mind

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

[USER]
which number? my prollific number?

[ASSISTANT]
Not your Prolific number. Please reply with a single number from 1 to 4 based on how well this interview captures how AI is changing your work, where 1 is poorly, 2 is partially, 3 is well, and 4 is very well. What number would you choose?

[USER]
2

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and thoughtful answers today. I appreciate your insights and wish you all the best in your work.

Duration: 43.41 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
software developer

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks. What kind of software do you work on, and what does a typical day look like for you?

[USER]
I work on B2B software. A typical day includes communicates with my three teammates, writing and testing code and reviewing each other's pull requests.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I think it comes does to doing meaningful work, having fair compensation, a supportive management, opportunities or growth, a reasonable workload and a good environment to work in.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say meaningful work, what does that look like for you in practice?

[USER]
Meaningful work means doing tasks that have a clear purpose and genuinely contributes to something  larger or helpful.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about supportive management in your world, what does that look like day to day?

[USER]
Clear communication, trust in my work, regular feedback, and being available to help remove obstacles when I need it.

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about a good environment to work in, what makes a workplace feel that way for you?

[USER]
It feels supportive, respectful, and collaborative, where people can communicate openly and do their best work without unnecessary stress or conflict.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It has a slight impact on my work by helping me summarize articles and gather general information but most of my focus is on understanding questions and generating clear responses.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it to summarize an article—what were you working on, and what did you do with the summary?

[USER]
I used AI to summarize a long internal memo which helped me to  highlight the key points so someone I could understand the main points and then I read the whole thing later.

[ASSISTANT]
In that memo example, what parts did it handle and what did you handle yourself?

[USER]
It handled summarizing the key points and organizing them in a clear and logical way where I handled what was important to include and what it should focus on.

[ASSISTANT]
Did it get anything wrong or miss something important in that summary, and if so, how did you handle it?

[USER]
No it did quite a good job of summarizing the main points.

[ASSISTANT]
When you looked over that summary, what went through your mind as you decided whether to trust it or dig deeper?

[USER]
That it was concise, well organized  and the summary wasn't too short nor too long.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you end up doing with the time you saved by starting with the summary before reading the full memo?

[USER]
I was able to get back to my work faster and more prepared the meeting I had to attend.

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned using it to gather general information. Can you tell me about a recent time you did that and what you were trying to find out?

[USER]
I was trying to compare a couple pieces of software that we as a company were looking into.

[ASSISTANT]
In that comparison case, what steps did you take with the AI, and what did you do yourself?

[USER]
I asked it to compare the two options and then gave it some criteria for what I wanted it to look at.

[ASSISTANT]
After it produced the comparison, how did you check whether the information was accurate enough to use?

[USER]
I looked at the links it provided as sources and went to a couple of the websites in order to check that the information was accurate.

[ASSISTANT]
When you used it for that comparison, what was your gut response to its output—did you feel inclined to trust it right away or keep it at arm’s length?

[USER]
I was inclined to trust it because it was well sourced and I had used in the past for a similar task that I found to be accurate.

[ASSISTANT]
Besides summaries and comparisons, was there another recent moment when it changed how you did a task?

[USER]
It helped me sort through some data

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me more about that data sorting. What was the dataset, and what were you trying to achieve with it?

[USER]
It was some data  for feature that we had implemented and we were trying to figure out if the data aligned with out expectations.

[ASSISTANT]
What steps did you take with the AI to sort or analyze that data, and what did you handle yourself?

[USER]
I asked it to put in in a graph and then I just gave it the parameters that I wanted.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It has some things just a bit easier to do.

[ASSISTANT]
Could you give me a recent example of a collaboration or conversation that went differently because you used it?

[USER]
I don't have anything specific that comes to mind

[ASSISTANT]
Have you noticed any changes in how your team splits up work or reviews each other’s code since these tools became available?

[USER]
Not really

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Sensitive or private data

[ASSISTANT]
What makes it important for you to keep work involving sensitive or private data in your own hands rather than giving it to an AI?

[USER]
To maintain privacy, security, legal compliance and control over how it is used.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over that work with sensitive data, how do you think it would change your role on the team?

[USER]
It would shift to overseeing the AI, checking its outputs, and ensuring security and compliance.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled that sensitive data flawlessly, what do you think would happen to the sense of trust between you, your teammates, and any clients?

[USER]
It would shift a bit towards the AI but human oversight would be still needed for overall confidence and acountability.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Menial task or things that can be easily automated.

[ASSISTANT]
What’s one specific task from this week that you’d hand over right away if you could?

[USER]
Cleaning up and formatting documentation

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up cleaning up and formatting documentation?

[USER]
Because it is tedious, repetitive and takes time away from more important work.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled the cleanup and formatting of documentation, would it change how your teammates view your contribution or your day-to-day role?

[USER]
No not really.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
It means having the freedom to make decisions and take responsibility for your work.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from recent weeks where you made a decision end to end and owned the outcome? What did that look like in practice?

[USER]
Last week I redesigned a feature, handled coding and testing and deployment, and addressed additional feedback from the beginning to the end.

[ASSISTANT]
In that redesign, where did you set your own direction and where did you need sign-off or input from others? What stands out to you about how you navigated that?

[USER]
I chose the design and implementation but I still go the approval on the plan and key features by balancing ownership with collaboration.

[ASSISTANT]
When AI is in the mix on a project like that, which decisions do you want to keep for yourself, and which are you comfortable letting the tool handle?

[USER]
I want to keep the creative judgment based decisions for myself and then let the AI handle the routine, technical or repetitive tasks.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
AI does a good job of speeding up repetitive task and helping with summarization and analysis but it doesn't replace the need for human judgment, creativity and accountability.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for your time and insights today. Is there anything else about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
No not really

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
content creator

[ASSISTANT]
What kind of content do you create, and on which platforms does it usually appear?

[USER]
I create different kind of videos on Youtube.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Fair pay and benefits. Growth, flexibility, and work life balance.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say flexibility, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
The flexibility to change my schedule from day to day according to my needs.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say growth, what does that mean to you in practice?

[USER]
Growth means that I stay happy and satisfied in what i do. It also means that i continue to learn and advance for long term goals and success.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about work life balance, what tells you it’s in a good place for you?

[USER]
When i feel content in my professional and personal life. When I do not feel burn out and have time for hobbies and relationships.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I appreciate AI because it acts as a powerful assistant that enhances efficiency and expands creative possibilities across all stages of production.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent video where you used it—what exactly did it help you do?

[USER]
AI helped me to create a great storyline and very likeable characters for a short horror film I created.

[ASSISTANT]
In that short horror film, what parts of the story and character work did the AI generate, and what parts did you craft yourself?

[USER]
Ai gave me the creepy story idea and spooky visuals and scenes. I myself created the script , music, and sound effects.

[ASSISTANT]
When you first saw the creepy idea and visuals it suggested, what went through your mind?

[USER]
I was happy and excited. I really liked what i saw.

[ASSISTANT]
Were there any suggestions from it that didn’t fit your vision, and if so, how did you handle that?

[USER]
I had no problems with any of the suggestions AI gave me.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to how you developed stories before using these tools, how did this change your process or timeline?

[USER]
Ai has absolutely made everything easier and faster. I am less stressed and a lot more productive.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that project?

[USER]
I had extra time to think about what I wanted my next video to be about and get a head start on that idea.

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it for ideas and visuals, where do you feel your own creative signature shows up most strongly in the final film?

[USER]
Mostly in the curation, refinement, and emotional direction.

[ASSISTANT]
Have you ever gotten something from it that was off or didn’t make sense for the project, and if that happened, how did you deal with it?

[USER]
No thats never happened.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I dont really have a working relationship with anyone. I work alone.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Nothing I can think of. I trust AI completely.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
If i could i would let AI take control over my entire job. It could create the video content entirely on its own and upload the videos on my chosen schedule.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you want to hand over the whole process rather than keep any part of it yourself?

[USER]
Because that's how much I trust and appreciate AI. It's a game changer.

[USER]
Hello?

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled everything end to end, how do you think that would change how your audience sees you or your channel?

[USER]
I had not thought of that. It would be seen as generic and unauthentic.

[ASSISTANT]
Given that concern, what, if anything, would you keep doing yourself to keep it feeling like you?

[USER]
I would continue to be in control of core creativity, ethical decisions, personal touches and factual accuracy.

[ASSISTANT]
Why are those particular areas important for you to keep rather than hand them over to AI?

[USER]
Over reliance on AI leads to generic content and legal risk. Therefore, emotional depth and unique perspectives would be lacking or non existent.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Develop their own style and ideas. Make sure the to keep total control of their content. Also, do not stifle their personal expression and creativity.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your channel of what “keeping total control of your content” looks like in practice?

[USER]
Implementing a comprehensive strategy from creation to distribution.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent video where you handled everything end to end—what specific decisions did you make at each stage from concept to upload?

[USER]
I chose a niche first. I decided on keyword and the target audience. I let Ai do most  of the work.

[ASSISTANT]
For that project, what were the exact calls you made yourself, and what did the tool generate or decide?

[USER]
I came up with the theme and storyline.  Ai created the characters, character voices and background audio.

[ASSISTANT]
Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is impacting your work?

[USER]
Ai is a wonderful and very innovative tool but it shouldn't be overused.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of this. Is there anything else you want to add about how these tools are changing your work before we close?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Interview 115
Username: 67e5ebfad8af26b1bb60e460
Date: 12/12/2025 18:16:09
Duration: 62.67 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hi! I work as a business analyst, which means I help teams understand problems, use data, and decide what to do next. I mostly translate between technical people and non-technical people so everyone’s on the same page.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job should pay enough to live comfortably and make you feel valued. It should also give stability and not leave you constantly stressed or burned out.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a job makes you feel valued, what does that look like in your day-to-day experience?

[USER]
It means my opinions are listened to and my work is acknowledged, not ignored. Simple things like feedback, trust, and basic respect make a big difference.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about stability, what signs tell you a job has it?

[USER]
Clear expectations, regular pay, and not constantly worrying about being let go are big signs. Long-term plans and honest communication also help a lot.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI helps me work faster by summarizing information, checking ideas, and handling repetitive tasks. It saves time so I can focus more on thinking and decision-making.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used it to summarize something at work, step by step? What did it do and what did you do?

[USER]
I pasted a long document into the tool and asked it to pull out the key points and actions. Then I checked the summary against the original, fixed anything missing or wrong, and shared the cleaned-up version.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, what kinds of points did it miss or get wrong when you compared the summary to the original?

[USER]
It sometimes missed small but important details, like dates or exceptions buried in the text. Occasionally it also oversimplified things that needed more context.

[ASSISTANT]
When you spotted those missed details or oversimplifications, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
I realized it was useful but not perfect. I knew I still had to read things myself and think carefully.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that summary task?

[USER]
I used the extra time to think through the problem more deeply and prepare better recommendations. It also gave me breathing room so I was less rushed.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent time you used it to check an idea. What did you ask it to do, and how did you use what it gave you?

[USER]
I explained my idea and asked if it made sense and what might be missing. I used the feedback to tweak my thinking not to replace it.

[ASSISTANT]
When you review and correct what it produced, how does that part of the work feel to you?

[USER]
It feels like proofreading someone else’s rough work. It is quicker than starting from scratch but still needs attention.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about a task you used to do without AI, how is it different now from start to finish?

[USER]
It starts faster because I am not staring at a blank page anymore. I still finish by reviewing and shaping the final result myself.

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned you shared the cleaned-up version. Who saw it, and what was that interaction like?

[USER]
I shared it with my team and a few stakeholders. The discussion was smoother because the main points were already clear.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a repetitive task you now let it handle. What did it do, and what did you do around it?

[USER]
I use it to draft first versions of routine emails or notes. I review them quickly make small changes and then send them.

[ASSISTANT]
Has there been a time when what it produced was so off that you set it aside and started over? What happened next?

[USER]
Yes there were times when it completely missed the point or sounded wrong. I stopped using it and just did the task myself from the beginning.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It has made collaboration easier because information is clearer and quicker to share. It has not replaced conversations but it helps people come prepared.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific meeting where people came in with AI-prepared material? What stood out to you about how that changed the conversation?

[USER]
People were more focused because the basics were already written down. The meeting spent more time on decisions instead of explanations.

[ASSISTANT]
Did AI change anything about how your manager or clients judge the quality or speed of your work?

[USER]
Yes there is more expectation that work is done faster now. Quality still matters but speed is noticed more than before.

[ASSISTANT]
Has it changed anything about how you and your colleagues divide up project work?

[USER]
Yes some tasks are done faster so people take on more thinking work instead of admin. It has shifted effort toward review and decision making rather than drafting.

[ASSISTANT]
Has using AI changed anything about who gets credit for work, or how people recognize each other’s contributions?

[USER]
It can sometimes blur who did what because the tool helped with early drafts. Clear communication still matters so people know who actually shaped the final work.

[ASSISTANT]
Have there been any tensions or awkward moments with colleagues because of how someone used an AI tool? What happened?

[USER]
Yes some people felt others relied on it too much and did not understand the work fully. It caused small trust issues until roles and expectations were clarified.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I would not hand over final decisions that affect people or money. I want a human to stay responsible for judgment and accountability.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping those final decisions in your hands important to you?

[USER]
Because those choices have real consequences for people. I believe humans should stay responsible for decisions that matter.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over those final calls, how do you think it would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
I would feel less trusted and less responsible for the outcome. It would make my role feel smaller and more mechanical.

[ASSISTANT]
Before a decision goes out, what is the last check you’d always want to do yourself rather than have an AI do it?

[USER]
I would always check if it makes sense and feels fair. I want to be sure it will not harm people or cause problems later.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would happily give it routine admin work like formatting documents and writing first drafts. That kind of work is necessary but does not need deep thinking.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those admin tasks the ones you’re most ready to hand off?

[USER]
They take time but do not need much judgment. Letting AI do them frees me up to focus on work that actually needs thinking.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those admin pieces, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
Yes I think people would see me as more focused on ideas and decisions. It would highlight the value of my thinking rather than busy work.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would say autonomy means you have the freedom to decide how you do your work and use your judgment. It means you are trusted to think and not just follow instructions blindly

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your work where you felt you had that freedom to decide how to do it, and what you did with that freedom in practice?

[USER]
I was given a problem to solve but not told how to solve it. I chose the approach the tools and the questions to ask and delivered the result my way

[ASSISTANT]
What told you that freedom was real in that situation, not just on paper?

[USER]
My manager trusted my choices and did not step in or micromanage. The work was accepted based on results not on whether I followed a strict process.

[ASSISTANT]
If someone new asked how to build that kind of freedom while using AI tools, what concrete steps would you suggest they take in their first few months?

[USER]
I would tell them to learn the basics well so they understand the work before using AI. They should use AI as support and always explain their thinking clearly so people trust them.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
Overall it feels like a helpful assistant not a replacement. It works best when people stay thoughtful and do not switch their brains off.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. Is there anything else you want to add about AI’s impact on your work?

[USER]
AI makes work faster but also raises expectations. It is useful as long as people stay responsible for the final outcome

[ASSISTANT]
Is there anything else you want to add, or does this capture the main ways AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
This captures the main ways AI affects my work. It helps with speed but still needs human judgment.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Duration: 27.31 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a research scientist

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Something that allows you to make a positive impact on the world, allows a good work life balance, provides challenge and reasonable compensation

[ASSISTANT]
When you say positive impact, what does that look like in your day to day work?

[USER]
Ultimately the goal of our science is to improve treatments for people with illnesses but there is quite a gap between the work i do day to day and that outcome

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about challenge, what kinds of challenges feel meaningful to you rather than draining?

[USER]
Challenges where I have to think creatively about a problem to get the results needed or collaborate with other to solve problems rather just challenges caused by unreasonable time pressures or administrative delays

[ASSISTANT]
When you say good work life balance, what does that look like for you in a typical week?

[USER]
Being able to work 9-5 (or less), flexibility about when I can do my work to allow for appointments and other life admin, being left with the energy for hobbies and activities outside of work

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use AI to some extent on a daily basis to help with coding problems. There is also a broader push in the field to include AI in many more experiments

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it for a coding problem? What was the task and how did you use it?

[USER]
The last time I used it for a coding problem was to help me clean some data in Python where I knew roughly what to do but a fairly complex regex was required so it was much faster to get chatgpt to solve this for me

[ASSISTANT]
In that regex task, what did you handle yourself and what parts did the tool generate for you?

[USER]
I provided the AI with some example values that I wanted to clean and my desired output, it gave me the code to use which I then implemented

[ASSISTANT]
Did the code it suggested work on the first run, or did you have to tweak or iterate on it?

[USER]
I had to iterate on it as there were exceptions that were not originally captured

[ASSISTANT]
When you hit those exceptions, what went through your mind, and how did you handle them?

[USER]
I wasn't particularly surprised, I just then provided chatgpt with some examples of the exceptions that were causing issues and asked it to update the code so that it worked for those as well

[ASSISTANT]
In that data cleaning task, how did using it affect your confidence in the final dataset you produced?

[USER]
I made sure to double check the dataset myself for errors but I was as confident in the final dataset as if I had coded it myself as I don't find regex easy to do

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing that data cleaning with it compare to how you would have done it before without it?

[USER]
It was likely a lot faster than if I had to do it myself which probably would have been more of a multi step process and involve looking up code snippets in other places

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that data cleaning task?

[USER]
I was able to spend that time on getting other tasks done

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned a broader push to include AI in more experiments. Can you tell me about a concrete example where that affected the design or expectations for one of your projects?

[USER]
We have not yet incorporated AI into any of our projects

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond coding help, are there other parts of your work where you turn to it?

[USER]
Occasionally I will ask for help with drafting an email, rephrasing some text or getting it to explain some obscure language#

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I don't think it has had any effect on them yet

[ASSISTANT]
Has it come up in conversations with colleagues or your manager, and if so what were those conversations like?

[USER]
My colleagues generally feel like AI is "over-hyped" and that our organisation is pushing it without a strong plan or guidance to go along with it

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a moment when that push showed up in a meeting or project discussion? What happened?

[USER]
It often has shown up in wider institute seminars where we are shown some examples of things that AI can do and encouraged to use it without the potential limitations really being discusssed

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
If the AI could do it perfectly then no I guess not. But I feel like there are some aspects of my job that would not be possible for an AI to deal with

[ASSISTANT]
Which parts do you think wouldn’t be possible for an AI to handle, and what makes those different from the rest of your work?

[USER]
There are things that occur that are very unexpected (e.g. a shipment accidentally going to the wrong continent) or that require negotiation with colleagues to figure out a non-standard way of working

[ASSISTANT]
When those surprises land on your plate, what do you draw on to navigate them — what skills or instincts do you find yourself using?

[USER]
I think generally you need to rely on the fact that most people want to help solve the problem - you need to communicate calmly and start working through options

[ASSISTANT]
In those negotiation or detour situations, if an AI tried to take the lead, what would concern you most?

[USER]
That because it can be a situation that hasn't happened before, they wouldn't have the previous experience to be able to iterate from

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Boring coding things like data cleaning where there isn't any creativity required to get the output, it's just quite mundane

[ASSISTANT]
What makes that kind of data cleaning feel like the right thing to hand off — what is it about it that you’d be glad to not do anymore?

[USER]
It isn't something intellectually challenging, it doesn't really require much problem solving but it can take up a huge amount of time without really making much progress

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled that data cleaning, would it change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
I don't think so, no

[ASSISTANT]
If you did hand off that data cleaning, what checks or guardrails would you want in place before you’d trust the outputs?

[USER]
I would want to review at least a subset of the output to understand what had been done. I'd also like the AI to outline the steps taken. Potentially I'd also use a test dataset first

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, if a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
To be able to make decisions around what you do on a day to day basis and to be given the opportunity to shape projects on a broader scale as well

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from a recent week when you made a day to day decision like that, and another moment when you helped shape the direction of a project? What did those look like in practice?

[USER]
I am able to choose in what order I want to work on what during the day. I have also been able to push for one of our projects to use a specific technology that I think would work best

[ASSISTANT]
What needs to be true in your workplace for you to be able to make those day to day choices and to shape a project like that?

[USER]
I need to have a manager that is willing to trust her employees and give them that freedom

[ASSISTANT]
When that trust shows up, what does it look like in concrete interactions with your manager?

[USER]
She will ask for my opinion on decisions, will not overly micro-manage or hover over my work and is happy as long as the work ultimately gets done

[ASSISTANT]
If a junior colleague asked you how to earn that kind of trust from a manager, what would you suggest they do in their first few months?

[USER]
Be reliable, make sure things are done in a timely manner, contribute to discussions, be organised

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
No that's all

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers!

Interview 117
Username: 5bead56b5324b10001c2551c
Date: 12/12/2025 18:14:28
Duration: 70.85 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a software test engineer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
If we are talking i terms of a workplace environment and job roles/tasks then I would have to say  something that gives you a sense of purpose would be pretty high up on my list.  The ability to carry out tasks autonomously without having someone micromanage everything you do and how you do it. Good work colleagues are also worth it.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a sense of purpose, what makes a job feel that way for you?

[USER]
I suppose it feels like you are actually providing something that people will use and actually benefit from using like in my case, I test healthcare systems so I know that the systems I actively work on directly go towards patient care.

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re able to work autonomously, what does that look like in your day to day testing work? Can you tell me about a time that happened?

[USER]
So we work using agile which means we have dedicated meetings each day for daily standups and we have some sessions mid week for refinement of items and sprint planning for future sprints. Outside of this I am free to pick up any task that is available on the sprint board and work on it until its complete, obviously there are estimates for how long a task will take and you generally work towards that but you can be flexible if something goes wrong or in the odd case something goes right and you do it quickly. Previously in my job I used to be assigned tasks by someone else which was not very good because i would often get assigned boring menial tasks that did not challenge me. Now I get to pick and choose (within reason) which tasks I work on and my colleagues will also pick and choose which work they work on. Eventually you have to work on boring tasks however compared to before when I wasnt able to work autonomously it is a significant amount less.

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned good work colleagues matter. What makes someone a good colleague in your team?

[USER]
Someone who you can send a message to at any point during the day and they will be happy to respond and even take time out of their day to talk to you or help assist you. Obviously it works both ways you have to be open and available to help them in return but together you can make a good "partnership"  or good team. You dont necessarily have to be friends but Its always nice to have someone there that you can bounce ideas off of or even transfer knowledge. Say you have to pickup a task they have done before, instead of getting lost in the weeds you can just simply ask them for advice and they will more than likely help you out, possiby even give you a head start.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
At the moment I would say we are in the early adoption phase. Most development teams have access to coding tools our organisation currently uses M365 Business copilot or whatever its called (but you can also use other tools as you see fit aslong as you dont share secure/private data), so it is able to help programmers within visual studio using copilot and it is also helpful for people in non technical roles with document generation or analysis and what not. Personally I find that I get alot of use out of AI tools mostly in regards to helping me understand, debug and sometimes write code. Ive also used it for tasks such as creating test scenarios or verification of my work things like that. At this point there isnt a day that goes by where I dont use AI tools.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used an AI tool to debug something in your tests? What did you do first, and then what did the tool do?

[USER]
So I created some gherkin scenarios based on some user stories we had in order to test an API PUT request. I had created corresponding step definitions but i was encountering errors with some of the code. First off, I expained abit of the background about what I was trying to do, what I had currently created and where I was stuck. I then also provided the error message I was provided by the console and pointed it towards the problematic function. The tool then did its thing and was able to spot a problem with the code however because it was missing context its original "fix" was misguided. So I realised that I needed to provide more context which lead to me copying the entire gherkin scenario and then also providing the functions leading up to the error step at this point it was able to understand the problem better and help me come up with some potential solutions which did infact work quite well. The way I generally work with AI tools is to carry out all the steps I outlined above but also to then ask it questions about why this might be the correct solution and if there are any alternatives or drawbacks to it. More often than not it will come up with some things I might not have thought about as alternative solutions or it will give a good reason as to why this solution is the right choice for the scenario.

[ASSISTANT]
In that debugging example, which parts did you do yourself and which parts did the tool effectively handle?

[USER]
I provided snippets of code and a short outline of what I was trying to achieve and just left it to figure out some solutions.

[ASSISTANT]
When its first fix was off because it lacked context, how did you decide what extra information to feed it next?

[USER]
I firstly tried to implement the provided fix and then there are two routes really, either I understand where its gone wrong from here and I change it to fix the problem I was having and then I report back to the assistant that its fix was actually incorrect and brought up another error to which i was able to fix by doing a specific action. At this point we might have a back and forth where it might say good job or we might come up with a better solution together. Or I just give it the new error that I received and let it figure out what I should try to do next.

[ASSISTANT]
When you saw that the first fix didn’t fit the situation, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
Well as Ive done some programming for over 5 years professionally I didnt think too much of it, my initial thought usually is that I didnt provide enough context for it to give me the correct answer or I didnt do a good job explaining what it was that I had already done and what I was trying to achieve

[ASSISTANT]
When the tool suggests a fix that looks plausible, how do you decide whether to trust it before you run it?

[USER]
I can understand the code that its providing me so Im aware of what it will do.

[ASSISTANT]
Has the tool ever given you a suggestion that turned out to be clearly wrong in your testing work? How did you handle it when that happened?

[USER]
Yes it has previously but that was due to me either missing some context or just making a stupid mistake. For instance I had a problem where I was trying to make a PUT request in python and for the life of me I couldnt figure out why it wasnt working. I used an ai tool to help me debug what would be going wrong and i went down quite a long rabbit hole where i spent maybe 2 hours testing various different fixes the tool suggested. In the end it was as simple as I was using ".post" instead of ".put" but neither I or the assistant noticed the very obvious error, it was only after I took a short walk that I noticed it when I sat down

[ASSISTANT]
When you realised it was .post instead of .put, what was your gut response in that moment?

[USER]
"What a waste of time oh well atleast it works now"

[ASSISTANT]
After that two-hour rabbit hole, did you change how you use the tool or set any guardrails for yourself?

[USER]
I remember not so much creating a guardrail for myself but reminding myself not to be so reliant on the tools, and to make sure that I actually put a fresh set of eyes on it to see if i can spot the problem some times before or after asking for help.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to doing similar debugging without these tools, how has your pace or workflow changed during a typical sprint?

[USER]
It has definetly sped up the debugging process. Previously debugging would revolve around getting an error you dont know or understand and having to search the internet or documentation for a good while until you find something that explains the error or you find someone that has also encountered the same error as you and knows how to fix it Then once fixed you would usually run into another problem and the cycle repeats itself until you fix all instances of an error which could take multiple hours. Now you can simply ask an AI tool, why is this not working and within seconds it can do all the searching that could have taken you hours and give you useful information or even a direct fix for your issue. Its sped up the workflow for everyone I work with

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used a tool to create test scenarios? What did it produce, and what did you end up changing before you used them?

[USER]
So out BA's were testing writing user story scenarios in Gherkin which we could then "use" however as they are new to it they werent exactly capable of being copy and pasted into feature files ready for use. So I gave it the user story detail and then provided the gherkin scenarios and asked it to convert them into gherkin scenarios that would be good for automation. For the most part i was provided with useful scenarios but there were formatting and wording changes I needed to make in order for them to line up with pre-existing test steps/step definitions. I dont think there was even one that I could just "use" as is without editing. But what it did do for me was provide me a good starting point and provided me with some output that achieved everything I wanted it to I just needed to make it match the style we use inhouse

[ASSISTANT]
When these tools speed things up for you, what do you usually do with the time you’ve freed up?

[USER]
Usually just more work I suppose. Its isped up the time it takes to do things so if i complete a user story 3 hours faster than i should have Ill either spend some time on some personal development or just simply go straight into starting my next user story.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
i suppose im asking my colleagues for advice or help alot less than i previously would have because its alot easier to just ask an AI assistant. Theres also the added fact that you can ask it anything no matter how stupid a question it might be and you get no judgement in the response. There are still some times where I will ask my colleageue directly when I know its something they have done before and have knowledge on because sometimes takling to someone can be helpful in building up abit of confidence for a task you arent that confident in. There are no real negatives that I can think of.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent moment when you chose to ask the tool instead of pinging a teammate? What happened after?

[USER]
There havent been many instances of that recently however If i see that my colleague is in a meeting ill just ask the assistant because its always available, rather than waiting for god knows how long until they finish their meeting. Usually I can get past my obstacle but if I need some confirmation from a colleague i can just ask them after implementing a solution.

[ASSISTANT]
Has using these tools changed how you and your teammates do code or test review and share knowledge with each other?

[USER]
I cant say that it has affected that really. We still do knowledge sharing sessions whenever someone has something they want to share with others, whether thats something they learnt on their own or something they learnt with the assistance of AI. Our test reviews currently are done manually and we dont use AI tools just yet for those.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I suppose things relating to data safety as we work with patient data and there are lots of rules around data safety which usually require human approval/intervention.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is that part important for you to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
I mean data safety is the utmost important thing for our organisation. Handing it all over to an AI  that makes its own rules and judgements would be very risky.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled those data safety decisions, how do you think it would change your role on the team or the way you interact with others?

[USER]
personally i dont think it would change alot for me. It would however make things quicker and easier to do in general because we wouldnt have to rely on a human to approve things relating to using or accessing specific data which currently is a road blocker for alot of teams and tasks.

[ASSISTANT]
What do you think a person adds in those decisions that a tool might miss?

[USER]
I couldnt tell you. Thats beyond my responsibilities and not something ive had to worry about so im not entirely sure whats so special about their approval either.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I mean hey if it can program all my tests for me why not. I f i could just be there to verify it was doing what we wanted then sure go for it. However it would then make my job probably obselete which would then in turn bring me lots of personal problems like not having a job or stable income.

[ASSISTANT]
What would make handing over the test programming worth it for you, given your concern about your role and income?

[USER]
If there was a guarantee that even with handing over the test programming there were jobs that were created off the back of it that I could transition into.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled most of the test programming, how do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
Well my role would most likely change but I couldnt tell you what my roles would be. Perhaps I would just be in charge or converting BA user stories into prompts for an assistant to create all the scenarios/tests for

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
So to have autonomy in my job today means im being trusted to communicate proactively/effectively, manage my time well and take responsibility for the outcomes of my work. But at the same time I am being given the freedom to, pick the tasks I work on, choose how to work on those tasks and manage my own schedule.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of a recent day where you did exactly that, from choosing a task through taking responsibility for the outcome? What happened step by step?

[USER]
Most days are exactly that, there are only some mandatory meetings I need to attend which occur at the same time every week. We have a sprint board that tracks work, I simply need to go on there and find a task that is open for testing and neither of my colleagues have started working on and put my name on the task. That task then becomes my responsibility. I am responsible for working on the task, providing updates on the task during our daily standups and managing it until completion when I ultimately have to sign off the item using my own name to say that it is complete. So I am taking repsonsibility for claiming that a piece of work has been tested sufficiently and is ready to be closed off, and in the future if there is a problem with that piece of work I will most likely have to answer for it (although I dont think its entirely negative however it does look poorly upon me should I not do a good job).

[ASSISTANT]
When AI suggests a different way to approach a task you’ve picked up, how do you decide whether to follow its approach or stick with your own plan?

[USER]
If I already know what to do in order to complete the task I will most likely do it the way I know how or if the suggestion from the assistant would end up taking me more time to implement or be overly complex for what it needs to achieve.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent time when you did change course based on the tool’s suggestion. What stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
Nothing particularly stands out im quite flexible in my thinking so if it genuinly seems like a better idea then ill just do it, im not precious about it having to be something that "I" thought of.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
Nothing further to cover from me.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Duration: 89.29 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work as a Segment Producer / Researcher for a media production company.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I think something that has tangible meaning. I have worked many accounting jobs that have little meaning, but this role can have an impact.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say tangible meaning, what does that look like in your day-to-day work?

[USER]
We produce shows that warn people of potentially adverse outcomes. I would say you can compare it to Ralph Nader's work, but more media.

[ASSISTANT]
Besides having an impact, what else matters most to you in a good job?

[USER]
The pay matters. Having a tolerable supervisor also matters

[ASSISTANT]
When you think of a tolerable supervisor, what qualities or behaviors make that true for you?

[USER]
I like supervisors who don't fly off the handle, or lose it, or display any type of chest-beating bravado.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I have used generative AI in my research and for brainstorming attempts.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it for research or brainstorming—what exactly were you trying to do?

[USER]
I was interested in legal verdicts and an insight into the most prominent attorneys and verdicts in various areas of the law.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, what did you ask the tool, and what did it give you back?

[USER]
I asked for specific attorneys and listings of verdicts in specific areas of the law, such a product liability law.

[ASSISTANT]
What did it return to you, and how did you end up using or checking that information in your work?

[USER]
I was not impressed with the attorney listings. Most of the information was wrong. The response listed many individuals who were in prominent roles but in different industries outside of law. The insights into verdicts were slightly better;  however,  many international cases were presented in the response

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized a lot of it was wrong or out of scope, what did you do next to handle that—can you walk me through your steps?

[USER]
I did not refine my prompts much. The general sense of incorrect data was enough for me to pause.

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when you saw those mismatches and international cases showing up—what was your gut response?

[USER]
I did not think the data was trustworthy. I also was fascinated by how you can be fooled by responses. I also considered previous non-law queries from the past. I wondered how gullible I may have been in those past non-law queries, too.

[ASSISTANT]
How do you normally research attorneys and verdicts without using these tools, and how did this experience compare to your usual process?

[USER]
I use fairly expensive databases. I have also researched and used many other sources, both free and paid services. Many new AI-assisted legal-specific AI tools are being touted. I have also researched legal AI tools for automating workflows and conducting research.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about one recent time you tried a legal‑specific AI tool—what was the task, and how did you use it?

[USER]
I saw an ad for some side work with an attorney. He told me about a workflow AI tool that could streamline his law practice. I studied the tool in depth. I noticed he had some preconceptions that were incorrect regarding costs.

[ASSISTANT]
What parts of his practice did the tool claim it would streamline, and what steps did it say it would handle?

[USER]
He had a divorce practice. There was significant paperwork transmission. The tool addressed such paper pushing and the form-filling process. The tool also had integrations with many standard legal practice case-pleading software products.

[ASSISTANT]
When you dug into that tool, what did you actually test or observe, and what did you conclude about where it would work well versus where it would stumble?

[USER]
At the price point the attorney mentioned, there were advantages. However, the attorney underestimated the API-access pricing. He envisioned using the API access to create a full-process solution. However, the actual cost was prohibitive.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I have been inspired by AI and also automation in general. The potential for productivity gains is clear. I am wary about bad information, and I don't see clear solutions to fact-checking.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific interaction with a colleague, manager, or client where AI came up—what was said, and how did that exchange go?

[USER]
I have seen where AI is touted in one area and admonished in other areas. One supervisor touted the use of AI in video creation. However, he complained about using it for research purposes. I think most top management types are unclear about what AI  is and what it can do.

[ASSISTANT]
When you heard that mix of praise and complaints from your supervisor, how did that shape what you chose to use these tools for in your day-to-day work?

[USER]
I don't tell my boss that I use AI and automation tools. He may blame quality issues on the AI. More importantly, he may request a reduction in pay if I simply press a few buttons and have AI do all the work. On a side note, there is a genuine fear in the legal industry that extensive AI use may bring on requests for legal hourly rate reductions from clients.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific time you chose not to mention using a tool—what was the situation, and how did you navigate that with your boss or client?

[USER]
I use my research to keep potential productions in the pipeline. When our pipeline becomes less full, my boss gets emotional and panicked. He often requests a more simplified approach. He does not realize that AI can shave 40% off the completion times. So, I hide my AI and automation use from him.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future, is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
My use of automation reduced my stress levels tremendously. I don't think humans should dwell in stress. It also allowed me to be more human by freeing up time to consider potential show topics in a more uniform and less rushed way. So, I think it is best to preserve the layered thinking for humans. However, it is AI and automation that create the extra time to be a human.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is that layered thinking important for you to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
There may be 20 variables in play when making a decision. I don't really see the current interface with AI being able to replicate that type of decision grid.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI did that layered thinking for you, how do you think it would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
I think such a scenario might put me out of a job, or I would be paid a reduced wage to simply perform AI babysitting. That is why I lie to my supervisor. If he knew that AI saves me 20 minutes every hour, he would want that money. He would ask how long it takes me with the use of AI, and he would want to pay me for only that time.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I have to compile contact information. I have toyed with the idea of automating this process. However, it's more complex than it appears on the surface. There were huge shifts during the pandemic, and that required a more human focus. However, I would gladly give that task to AI, and I may write the code soon to automate the process. Some lookup aspects are already automated. On a side note, there are interesting benchmarks surrounding the percentage of a task that can be automated --- the 80-20 split referenced in some papers and books on the subject.

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to hand off the contact‑compiling work to a tool?

[USER]
It can do a better job with fewer errors. The trade-off is the time it takes you to streamline the code creation, and testing, and fixing glitches. So, a general feel of how long your employment will continue impacts your tool selections.

[ASSISTANT]
If a tool handled the contact‑compiling for you, how do you think it would change how others see your contribution on the team?

[USER]
They would not notice. It is a minute and small part of the overall process  The bottom line is they would want to pay me less!! I am very wary of that fact.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I think AI and automation. I think relying on your own skills and not delegating everything to generative AI is important, too. Applying my automation programming was an astounding experience for me. I have lots of programming experience from high-frequency stock trading. I applied that to text analysis. It turned a tedious, stressful job into something fun. Most importantly, it put me in control. It enabled me to increase my wage secretly. It gave me great autonomy. The automation made me feel like an independent contractor, with independence and options.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example of a day when your automation changed the way you worked, and what stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
I was going to quit my job after 2 weeks. Given the production line quality of the job, there was enormous stress when I could not find specific instances that matched the required criteria. I tried to apply automation as a last-ditch effort, and I realized it could work well. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had as an employee.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say it put you in control like an independent contractor, what could you decide or do differently in a typical day that you couldn’t before?

[USER]
I could maneuver. I could make quick adjustments to meet time constraints. I had more options to meet my work obligations. The automation shaved 40% off my workload and completion times. However, my stress levels went down by 90%!!

[ASSISTANT]
I hear two possible meanings in what you’ve said. Do you mean having the freedom to choose your own tools and pacing to hit goals, or do you mean having the final say on the content and standards of the work—or is it something else altogether?

[USER]
I mean maneuvering. I have to analyze a document that is 1000s of pages with minimal interface options. The tools I use enable me to work with greater control. I have control over the document and the pages.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through one specific script or workflow you built that let you “maneuver” inside those thousand‑page documents, and what you actually did with it on a real piece of work?

[USER]
I am able to expand upon the interfaces available to me. I can act upon criteria requests that are imposed on me. I have greater sorting and filtering capabilities. I can adjust to different time zones and time constraints. One specific insight is my ability to pick out specific case types and similar information that is not possible through the interface of the database.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of this. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI has affected your work that we haven’t talked about yet?

[USER]
No.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for taking the time to share such clear examples and reflections. Your insights on how these tools change your pace, stress, and choices will be very valuable for our study. Wishing you all the best in your work.

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an it manager for a private company who oversee technology used by policing

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good pay, a challenging set up and something that makes the difference to people day to day

[ASSISTANT]
When you say a challenging set up, what does that look like for you day to day?

[USER]
A job that gives you a challenge and opportunity to learn

[ASSISTANT]
When you say it makes a difference to people day to day, what does that look like in practice? How do you notice it?

[USER]
I do not notice it, but I don’t need too. I know that the little things we implement are making a difference to the public

[ASSISTANT]
Of the things you mentioned, which one matters most to you right now, and why?

[USER]
Making a difference to the public and improving lives

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
Ai helps, I use it to summarise emails and meetings, I use it as my spell checker and to make more sense of my writing, I also use it to help improve my code, and answer any day to day questions I may have

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it to summarise a meeting? What happened from start to finish?

[USER]
Due to my schedule I often can not make certain meetings so I use copilot to help summarise hour long meetings so I don’t need to spend another hour watching them

[ASSISTANT]
In that meeting example, what did Copilot actually give you, and what did you do with it once you got the summary?

[USER]
It gave me the whole subscript and then pointed out the key points, thankfully the last meeting didn’t have any actions for me, but it would pull out actions if required

[ASSISTANT]
The first few times you used it for meeting summaries, what went through your mind as you read them?

[USER]
I was quite amazed, it was really helpful and pretty actuate

[ASSISTANT]
Has Copilot ever gotten a meeting summary wrong or missed something you later realized mattered? What did you do in that situation?

[USER]
Erm, not that I know of,nor have been called out for, I do not seem to have missed any actions from copilot as of yet

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about the last time you used it to help with your code. What did you ask it for, and how did you use what it produced?

[USER]
I asked it to clear it up and remove anything that wasn’t required, and yes I did use the code, the added comments was very helpful

[ASSISTANT]
After it cleaned up your code, how did you check that the changes were safe and did what you needed?

[USER]
I complied it and ran it, all worked as required

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it to make more sense of your writing, what do you actually do step by step, and what do you look for in its suggestions?

[USER]
I write what I want to say then paste it into copilot or ChatGPT saying what I want out of it then let ai make the right corrections an reword it to how I want it

[ASSISTANT]
When these tools save you time, what do you usually do with that time in your day?

[USER]
Carry on with other things required

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it for writing or code, what’s your gut response about trusting what it gives you?

[USER]
I scan it, if it makes

[ASSISTANT]
Sounds like that thought got cut off. Could you finish it for me—how do you decide whether to trust what it gives you?

[USER]
logical sense then I will trust it, if there are oddities I will look into them

[ASSISTANT]
Can you recall a time you spotted an oddity in what it produced? What was off about it, and what did you do next?

[USER]
No yet really, I manage the developers so anything rather in-depth or detailed I’ll pass the work on to them, but for my requirements I have not seen any issues yet

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I think it actually has brought us closer together

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a moment when you felt it brought you closer together—what happened and what stood out to you about that interaction?

[USER]
It’s a running joke in our team now if we get a question we all race to copilot to see its response

[ASSISTANT]
Has having these tools changed how your team divides up tasks or who takes the first pass on things?

[USER]
Not yet, no

[ASSISTANT]
Has it changed anything about how you communicate with managers or clients, for example how you prepare updates or respond to their questions?

[USER]
Yes, as said before i normally run my emails through copilot first before I send it to clients  or anyone really

[ASSISTANT]
What reactions have you noticed from managers or clients when they realize you used AI to help draft or prepare something?

[USER]
Nothing, I always adapt the response so it doesn’t seem like it is ai generated

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I would like to have a career in the future, there are parts of my role which can not be taken over by ai

[ASSISTANT]
Which parts of your role are the ones you would want to keep yourself?

[USER]
I have to train and put in the restraints to the ai so that could never be replaced hopefully

[ASSISTANT]
Why is being the person who trains the system and sets its boundaries important for you to keep? What makes that part matter to you?

[USER]
So we always have overall control of the outcomes

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI did the training and boundary setting instead of you, how do you think that would change your role on the team or your relationships with colleagues and stakeholders?

[USER]
If that was to happen we would stop using ai

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
The basic easy stuff, the daily reporting and easy tasks

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up the daily reporting and easy tasks? What makes those the right fit to hand over?

[USER]
They take a great earl of time and effort for little outcome

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those reports and easy tasks, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
No not at all, it is just a change in the way of working

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I’ll go down the route of explain how something like Alexa works. It is helpful and answers the questions, however it will never been 100% correct and there are always developers behind it making the automation happen

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your own work where you were “the developer behind it,” setting things up so the system could help but not run the show? What happened?

[USER]
I have put In strict rules for copilot at work making sure it can not have access to all our work data as  a lot is sensitive and should not be shared outside the company.

[ASSISTANT]
When you set those strict rules, what exactly did you restrict and why? Were there any tough calls where you had to weigh usefulness against keeping data locked down?

[USER]
We work with very sensitive data which can not and should not ever be sent to a data center along with gdpr we need to keep certain information secure

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through one specific policy or configuration you put in place, and a moment when someone bumped into that limit? What happened next?

[USER]
Users should not bump into the limit they are all highly trained on what can and can not be shared outside of the company

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else about how AI is affecting your work that you think we haven’t covered but should?

[USER]
I believe it is helpful and useful as long as it is used sensibly

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of this. Is there anything else about how AI is changing your work that you want to add before we finish?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

[USER]

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for taking the time and sharing your experiences. I appreciate the clarity and the concrete examples from your day to day work. Wishing you all the best as you continue shaping how these tools are used in your team.

Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an IT Operations Manager

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Clear hours, well paid, good benefits

[ASSISTANT]
When you say clear hours, what does that look like for you day to day?

[USER]
I prefer a solid 9-5.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say good benefits, which ones matter most to you and why?

[USER]
Perks mostly. holiday pay, pension maybe, sick leave

[ASSISTANT]
When you say well paid, what tells you the pay is at the right level for you?

[USER]
When all my bills are paid, and I'm able to save some every month

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It impacts it though not as much as many think. I use AI to help with things like scripting, and batch files where a single syntax error can make it all fall apart. I might use it sometimes for some research, though I have to be very careful that it doesn't make things up. I've also used it to help me come up with a better way to say something when I'm making an email and I need it to sound a certain way

[ASSISTANT]
In that scripting example, which parts did the AI handle and which parts did you do yourself?

[USER]
I usually feed the AI what I want the script to do, and what I have for the script already. Then have it finish it off or make it better

[ASSISTANT]
When the AI finishes or improves a script, does it ever get things wrong, and if so how do you handle that?

[USER]
It hasn't yet. I usually get scripts far more wrong than the AI does

[ASSISTANT]
When you get a script from the AI, how do you test or review it before you run it in your environment?

[USER]
Honestly, I don't.

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind the first time you ran an AI generated script without testing it?

[USER]
Nothing really.  I have yet to find any incidents of an AI model making a script that does 'bad'. Usually the scripts have mostly been written by me but aren't working, so I can glance over the AI generated script and see what I did wrong

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned being careful with research because it can make things up. Can you tell me about a time that happened and how you spotted it?

[USER]
I was researching some equipment purchases, new switches for an office. I was looking into cloud managed switches. The AI (ChatGPT) fed me some names and one I knew had gone out of business two years before.

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized the model listed a company that had shut down, how did that change the way you use it for research going forward?

[USER]
It just meant I had to make sure to double check most things. It was still a bit faster than doing it all on my own, but I did spend a decent amount of time making sure things were accurate

[ASSISTANT]
When the AI helps you spot what went wrong in your script, what stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
That I'm bad at scripting and it's why I'm not a programmer

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it to shape an email, how do you split the work between what you write yourself and what you ask the tool to generate or edit?

[USER]
It's almost always the following format: I write the email fully myself.  with all the needed information. But it tends to come across as a bit stiff and cold. I will usually copy the email into the AI I'm using and ask it to make it warmer and more personable.

[ASSISTANT]
When the tool makes your email warmer, what’s your gut response when you read the revised version?

[USER]
It always reads a bit trite to my ears, but I know I'm cynical and ignore that sort of stuff often

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It hasn't really. It's just another tool to me

[ASSISTANT]
Have you talked with your teammates or peers about using it, and if so what were those conversations like?

[USER]
Occasionally. Most of them were fine. There's a few outliers in both ways. Some who put AI on a pedestal, and those who hate AI with passion. Most are like me, just another tool that is useful in certain areas to fill in places of weakness

[ASSISTANT]
Has using it changed what your manager expects from you, like speed, responsiveness, or how polished things should be?

[USER]
Not that I've been aware of

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future, is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I rather enjoy troubleshooting. So I'd rather not have AI get involved in that

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about troubleshooting that you enjoy?

[USER]
It's finding the problem. It makes me think and consider things, and I enjoy that aspect.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over the troubleshooting, how do you think that would change your role on the team?

[USER]
I'd keep my role but my job would be far more boring

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Network Optimization

[ASSISTANT]
What makes network optimization the thing you’d hand off first?

[USER]
Simple. Finding any tweaks and changes to make a network run smoother is fine, but implementing them can be never wracking. Your talking a change that could, if it goes south, break not one persons computer but the whole work network.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI proposed and implemented those optimization changes, what kinds of safeguards or rollback plans would you want in place before letting it push them live?

[USER]
I'd always want a backup config that *I* took so I could roll back if needed.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
That the autonomy in IT is still there. Honestly, most people are sort of still intimidated by tech, and are generally happy to have us fix their issues. As long as you can be somewhat personable, and you narrow down to a few skills and excel at those, you can go far.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice in your current job?

[USER]
For the most part the number one thing is that we get left alone. As long as everything is working, most people don't care about IT one way or another. So,  we make out own schedules, figure things out in our own time.

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent day when you set your own plan for the work. What choices did you make about what to tackle first, and where did AI fit in, if at all?

[USER]
I usually sit down and handle any tickets that have easy things first. Once I've fixed those, then I tend to move into projects, and there I use AI more. Like making a script to report out data out of the domain, or using AI to consolidate reports about switch use and firewall data.

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might understand what you said — that it means deciding how to do the work without much oversight, or that it means choosing which work to do first and when to do it. Which of these captures better what you mean, or do you mean something else altogether?

[USER]
this first one

[ASSISTANT]
When you decide how to do the work without much oversight, what constraints or guardrails do you still have to keep in mind?

[USER]
that it all gets done,  triage the easy things that affects users day to day, then move into longer term things

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work before we wrap up?

[USER]
Not really. Most think AI is going to destroy jobs. I don't. At best I think it will be what it is now. a useful tool.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we close, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
No\

[ASSISTANT]

Duration: 24.59 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work as a Senior tech support technician.   I mainly provide support to lower levels of tech support.  I also help onboard new employees and grant software access.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
It should be something that you actually enjoy doing and something that makes a difference in the world.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say it should make a difference, what does that look like in your day-to-day terms?

[USER]
In my case, helping people with their tech issues so they can do their job.

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond enjoyment and making a difference, what else matters most to you in a good job?

[USER]
Good management, especially at the top.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think of good management, what does that look like in practice from where you sit?

[USER]
Management that actually cares about you and doesn't treat you like you are replaceable.   Management that is easy to approach and open to new ideas.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI actually greatly helps me work.  I've been able to use AI to get things done quicker and take some of the load off.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used it on a specific task, step by step? What did you do and what did it do?

[USER]
I had AI help me automate some onboarding emails that we send out.  We used to do these manually but AI helped me automate this so less human interaction is needed.

[ASSISTANT]
In that onboarding email automation example, which parts did you design and which parts did the AI generate?

[USER]
I just designed the basic template for the email, AI helped to show me how I can automate that by inputting the names and addresses I need as well as sending that.

[ASSISTANT]
When you first set that up, did anything go wrong or come out odd, and if so, how did you handle it?

[USER]
Yes.  At first I ran into an issue with the script that AI provided me.  It was having issues actually sending the email.  I took a look at it and figured out the issue so I was able to get that fixed.   I can also credit part of the fix to AI, as it helped me with that new script.

[ASSISTANT]
When you hit that sending issue, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
I really just wanted to get it resolved right away.  I was a bit frustrated but I was determined to fix it.

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing the onboarding emails this way compare to your process before you brought AI into it?

[USER]
It has saved a lot of time.  Sometimes we have to send out 50+ emails out to new users.  This can take a lot of time doing it manually.   Now it is very fast and something I don't dread doing.

[ASSISTANT]
What do you usually do with the time you’ve freed up from automating those emails?

[USER]
I just use this time to work on other projects.

[ASSISTANT]
Besides the onboarding emails, can you tell me about another task in your role where you’ve brought AI into the process? What does that look like in practice?

[USER]
Another task would be Airtable integration.  We just started using Airtable instead of Excel and I asked AI to help me with that.

[ASSISTANT]
In that Airtable case, what did you ask it to help with, and which parts did you end up doing yourself versus what it produced for you?

[USER]
I asked help for it with using formulas in Airtable.  Basically it would automatically input information that I needed.   I ended up doing the majority of it, AI just helped me understand Airtable formulas and how to use them the best.

[ASSISTANT]
When AI suggested a formula in Airtable, how did you decide whether to trust it or adjust it—what was your gut check or test?

[USER]
Luckily there is a test function for Airtable formulas so I was able to see if that worked before I made it part of the table.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I don't really think AI has affected my working relationships much.   I guess we have something to talk/bond over when discussing how we can use AI.

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned having something to bond over. Can you tell me about a recent conversation with a colleague about using AI and what, if anything, changed in how you worked together afterward?

[USER]
I was talking to someone at my job that does software engineering.  We were talking about ChatGPT and everything it can do.  They mentioned to me that ChatGPT can program entire lines of code for them, I found that very interesting.
This was someone that I really haven't talked to much so this was a good bonding experience with someone that does different work than me.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future, is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I would never want AI to take over any human interactions I have.  When I am working with one of our users, I think human interaction is best to help them when they are frustrated or don't understand something.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those interactions important to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
I think humans can solve these issues quicker.  I also think you need that human element to help understand what's going on and be empathetic towards them.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled those user interactions instead of you, how do you think it would change your relationships with the people you support or your role on the team?

[USER]
I think it would be very negative.  I think AI taking over those interactions would make people not trust IT workers as much.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent support interaction where being there in person or live made a clear difference in how it turned out? What stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
A recent time that being in person made a difference was when I was helping an executive at my work.  Some executives can be hard to work with because they are very busy and want fast results.   Based on my previous experience with them, I remembered that they aren't the best at reguarly restarting their computer.   Luckily the issue they were having was just some stuck updates so a simple restart was able to fix their issue.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Granting software access.   This is something my company still doesn't manually for the most part.   I really hope AI can take this over soon.

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to hand over granting software access—what makes that the right task to give up?

[USER]
It's something that can be automated very easily.  Our process is that the user requests the software, then it goes through any approval needed and then the access is granted.  I don't really see a need for a human in all of this.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled granting software access, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
No I don't think it would.   I don't think the average user understand the process for software access.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them that autonomy is actually a very important part of this job.  You need to be able to kind of be your own boss and know what you need to do next.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from a recent day where you “were your own boss” — what decisions you made without checking in, and how you decided what to tackle first?

[USER]
Really that's kind of my job everyday but an example would be when you first sign on for the day.   The average tech worker has a ton of tickets, calls, and emails to go through.  It's your job to figure out which ones are the most important and what to work on first.

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re sorting those tickets, calls, and emails, what cues do you rely on to judge urgency and importance in the moment?

[USER]
If they currently cannot do their job at all because of the tech issue, then this would be an urgent task.   If it's something like their screen isn't as bright as they'd like, this is something that can wait.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about everything you’ve said, has using AI changed what “being your own boss” looks like in your role, and if so, how?

[USER]
Yes I think AI has given me more freedom.  With the AI knowledge, that can help me with the basic tasks so I can work on more urgent tasks.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific day when AI took some basic tasks off your plate and how you used that space—what you did first, then next?

[USER]
Sure.  Going back to the onboarding emails, a few weeks ago we had a ton of emails that needed to go out.  Luckily AI's helped with that gave me more time.  With this time I was able to get a head start on the next weeks onboardings.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
I'd just like to say I think AI has been very positive in my job and I'm thankful for it.  I'm very curious to see where it goes in the future and I really hope it doesn't steal my job lol.

[ASSISTANT]
I appreciate you sharing that. Is there anything else you want to add, or does this cover it for you?

[USER]
That's it.  Thanks

[ASSISTANT]

Duration: 32.88 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work in software development.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job has scheduling freedom, regular hours, and high pay.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say scheduling freedom, what does that look like for you day to day?

[USER]
Being able to easily reschedule around sudden events easily or flexible hours which aren't restricted to a single shift.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say regular hours, what does that mean to you in practice?

[USER]
Reliable weekly full time hours and/or consistent available which allow for confidence in the work and prevent confusion.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say high pay, what does that mean to you in practice?

[USER]
Enough to live comfortably and have money left over for myself. An amount that prevents me from being concerned about my finances.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
Ai is often used in software to speed up production and handle repetitive time consuming tasks. However, more and more people are using it to replace their own work, in other words to get away with lazyness, and more and more companies are using it to replace employees at the cost of product quality.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent task where you used AI in your own work, and walk me through what you did and what the AI did?

[USER]
I converted a list of values into a table by telling an AI to reformat the information. Unfortunately, I have a hard time trusting results so I still had to manually check the whole thing . It still did save time in the end though, which is part of the problem.

[ASSISTANT]
When you reviewed the table, did you notice any specific errors or patterns you were watching for, and how did you handle them?

[USER]
I didn't find any errors that time, but that doesn't mean there won't be any next time. Usually the errors involve faulty lines or missing information. Hallucinations are also extremely common, but not in that particular task.

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re deciding whether to use it on a task like that, what goes through your mind?

[USER]
Its almost always a question of efficiency. Can I do this faster or cheaper using AI than a traditional method. Or if I'm told to by the higher ups.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time it hallucinated or left out information on a work task, and what you did in response?

[USER]
The most common hallucination event is when performing a tasks that spans two different version updates. AI gets very easily confused about which features have been removed or added. In other words, it has a hard time maintaining the concept of permanency or internal consistency. The only thing I can do in response is manually review it ever time.

[ASSISTANT]
When you realize you have to manually review it every time, what stands out to you about that experience?

[USER]
It's annoying to check for hallucinations because it's a tedious process that is sometimes hard to verify. I wish AI could maintain better internal memory.

[ASSISTANT]
When it does save you time, what do you typically do with that reclaimed time?

[USER]
Additional work productivity.

[ASSISTANT]
How does doing a task with AI compare to how you handled the same kind of task before you started using it?

[USER]
When I perform tasks myself I usually have to spend time learning and adjusting before I can perform the task as a satisfactory level of quality or speed, but the AI will generally perform the same way from the first time. That can be a good thing or a bad thing.

[ASSISTANT]
In a recent project, where did you draw the line between what you let the AI generate and what you kept for yourself?

[USER]
Almost any time we have a task that involved the AI gathering information for itself, such as collecting search results or performing a web search, I throw out the entire thing and do it myself. Performing tasks with internal data or premade data tables is generally reliable but external data is almost always unreliable or contains hallucinations. You can check this by attempting to use the Google Search AI summary. 99% of the time it is completely and utterly false information.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Ai has caused significant problems with socialization both in and out of the office. People won't write their own texts, emails, or reports anymore and will instead have AI do it. Harming their literacy and communication skills.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent interaction where you suspected a message was AI‑written and it changed how the exchange went? What happened?

[USER]
Almost all in office emails and memos, and reports. There is no official policy on the subject yet so there's not really anything that can be done about it, and if I confront the individual they simply deny it or change the wording later.

[ASSISTANT]
How has this shift affected trust or coordination on your team?

[USER]
People were always the most unreliable part of an organization, but it's hard to trust people have proper understanding and competency if they can't even exchange communications on their own.

[ASSISTANT]
What conversations, if any, have you had with your manager about how and when to use these tools?

[USER]
None, because they do it to, which often leads to vague or unclear instructions.

[ASSISTANT]
When you get vague or unclear instructions that you suspect were AI‑generated, how do you respond to move the work forward?

[USER]
I simply perform my tasks anyway and let the company deal with the repercussions, which is usually performing extra work later at cost.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Managing employee accounts, personal data, account access, passwords, security etc. It is so unbelievably easy to manipulate and trick AI. It is the opposite of safe and secure.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you want to keep that responsibility yourself?

[USER]
To maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and security of information.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time you saw an AI get manipulated in a way that would worry you if it had access to accounts or sensitive systems?

[USER]
Any time you talks to AI, as long as you carefully phrase things, you can get them to say or do mostly anything.

[ASSISTANT]
If someone proposed using an AI for parts of account or access management, what would you need to see or test to even consider giving it limited responsibilities?

[USER]
I wouldn't even consider it to begin with until the far future where I've seen proof it's secure, or the concept of AI has changed completely. Currently the way AI works, there's no way to remove or partition off data in a reliable way.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Not sure, maybe collecting daily reports so I could have it all in one place easily at the start of the shift, if I could trust it was providing an accurate change log.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes that report‑gathering worth offloading—what would you gain if an assistant handled it reliably?

[USER]
It would save a lot of time. It's an extensive amount of work to shift through and organize daily progress reports, especially when working with a code base.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled that report gathering, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
Not really, that's not the primary role I perform.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
The ability to choose my work format, for example whether I work from home or in office, as well as the ability to perform my job in a way decided by me without direct supervision beyond regular check ins, updates, and task assignments. In other words, a good employee with a high degree of trust.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example from your job where you had that kind of autonomy, and walk me through what you did and how it played out?

[USER]
I was given a month to create a white paper report on a solution to a proposed software solution. Basically what the company could do to serve a client's needs, and present it for review.

[ASSISTANT]
In that white paper project, what were the key decisions you made on your own without asking for sign‑off, and what happened as a result?

[USER]
I presenting the software solution, how we could design it, and how it would perform the requested role. It was basically a product design document presented for review by the board.

[ASSISTANT]
In that project, how did you set your own process and checkpoints, and what told you that you were free to proceed in your own way?

[USER]
I designed the entire document from the ground up with no overview aside from the deadline.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
Not really. I'm worried about people's job security especially in the creative arts where people can dump out literally infinite slop to replace artists work.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers!

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I’m glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
sure i work in the IT field. I'm the supervisor and manager of a private firm that recruits people for advertising

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
well to me the cores are having good benefits, good working hours and being able to expand and increase your promotion in the field

[ASSISTANT]
When you say good benefits, what does that mean in practice for you?

[USER]
to me that means having certain things covered like PTO , an emergency leave and have insurance benefits

[ASSISTANT]
When you think of good working hours, what does a week that feels right look like for you?

[USER]
a good week for me is 40+ hours and a additional 10 with overtime for extra income

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about expanding and moving up, what does that look like for you day to day?

[USER]
to me that means not being stuck in a single job position. being able to work your way up the ladder and being able to improve your position in the company

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
sure we use AI here and there  but recently its been a push to use prompts and chat gpt to improve the way we distribute ads. To me its fine as it is but its becoming more and more normalized in my field

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent time you used it to distribute ads, step by step? What did you do, and what did the AI do?

[USER]
sure. a month ago we had a advertisement request for a big company but the things they wanted needed a bunch of green screen and set photos we haven't received yet so instead of waiting we just decided to form our own prompts with AI which made it easier but I'm not sure the quality stayed the same

[ASSISTANT]
In that project, what exactly did you generate with prompts, and what parts did you handle afterward yourself?

[USER]
we generated sports cars, the tropical landscape and we changed what the main people were wearing. afterwards I had to handle the post cleanup to make sure everything looked fine and no glitches occurred

[ASSISTANT]
What kinds of glitches or issues did you notice in the cleanup, and how did you handle them?

[USER]
some people had extra fingers. some of the prompts had artifacting and a few more just had very glaring issues with the videos. we basically just remade the prompts until we got exactly what we wanted and kept editing it to look better and better

[ASSISTANT]
When you first saw those errors, what went through your mind?

[USER]
to me I thought yea this is why having an editing crew is better then using this by a mile and should never be used by professionals

[ASSISTANT]
Did working this way leave you feeling more confident in the final ad, or less, and why?

[USER]
It left me feeling a tad bit more confident yes but at the same time I could see the limits it had and why it wasn't the best.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared with how you would have done this before, how did the timeline change on that project?

[USER]
well we finished it much quicker in about 4-5 days instead of the usual 2-3 weeks of editing

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved by finishing in 4 to 5 days instead of a few weeks?

[USER]
well we made an extra video just in case so we could compare them and the advertisers could pick out which they liked best.

[ASSISTANT]
How did the advertisers respond when they compared the two videos?

[USER]
they were impressed and happy we had different choices to pick from as opposed to the usual 1

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
well for me its made some things easier but in tern its taken work away from me that otherwise I could do myself just fine

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific time when work shifted away from you because of these tools, and what the conversation with your manager or team was like?

[USER]
sure a few weeks ago our team got a request for something simple that would take maybe 1-2 days but another team member requested be use AI to do it in less the an hour. personally I pushed back because it has always been done the old way and when I told my higher up they asked me to give the new way a chance

[ASSISTANT]
What happened next on that request — did you go ahead with the AI approach, and how did you respond in the moment?

[USER]
yes we did. the AI approach was much quicker but I think I could have done a better job. I was angry until my lunch break but I managed to get over it

[ASSISTANT]
How did that moment affect how you work with the teammate who pushed for using AI?

[USER]
well It wasn't much of a team effort only a few people worked on it for that reason but it did make me side eye my teammate for the suggestion

[ASSISTANT]
After that push to use AI, did anything shift in how your manager talks with you about expectations or trust?

[USER]
yes we had a personal meeting on how I should be more open minded and how AI is here to help us not hurt us.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
well personally my job of course I wouldn't want to be done by AI but also most tech jobs need human interaction to fix a problem so id say that. anything in my main field I would prefer is done by a person

[ASSISTANT]
Why is it important to you that people handle the troubleshooting parts rather than an AI?

[USER]
because if the AI is lost it could give you wrong information and everyone situation is different so it should account for that too

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over the troubleshooting parts, how do you think that would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
well me and my teammates would be forced to remove that part of the job from our schedule but I don't think it would change too much

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about those messy troubleshooting situations, what stands out to you about what a person brings that an AI wouldn’t?

[USER]
a person would bring their past experiences when dealing with it and have a layer of knowledge just from studying the work

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
the calls from clients could be 100% AI tomorrow and I would be happy

[ASSISTANT]
What makes the client calls the first thing you would hand off?

[USER]
way too much small talk and figuring out exactly what they want

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those calls, how do you think it would change how others see your contribution on the team?

[USER]
it wouldn't change my contribution. those calls are the parts of the job that can be completely replaced

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
it means having the right to govern yourself and the thing you do

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your job where you got to govern yourself in that way, and what that looked like in practice?

[USER]
sure a year ago when my boss was on vacation we were still expected to meet deadlines and finish projects. I was able to manage my whole team without any help and felt very independent

[ASSISTANT]
In that stretch while your boss was away, what were the key calls you made on your own, and how did you know it was yours to decide rather than wait for approval?

[USER]
when the start projects, when to stop them, how much to get paid etc. and nobody else was over me at the time so I was the only to make the decisions myself

[ASSISTANT]
When AI is part of the project, what changes about your ability to make those calls on your own?

[USER]
well AI makes it so most calls can be made early. you don't need a bunch of people directing you and following you the AI can do most of it alone

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t touched on?

[USER]
not at the moment. AI is having a positive impact on my work life at the moment but that's only for now

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of this. Do you feel there’s anything important we missed, or does this cover the main ways AI is affecting your work right now?

Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

[USER]
its covered everything. and 4 it describes it very well

Duration: 17.12 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm a UI/UX engineer, but I also teach on the side.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job allows flexibility, has good time off, good coworkers, and allows you to work at your own pace.

[ASSISTANT]
Of the things you mentioned, which one matters most to you right now, and why?

[USER]
Being able to work at my own pace.

[ASSISTANT]
What does working at your own pace look like for you in practice, day to day, in your engineering and teaching roles?

[USER]
It means I can work at night if I want to or during the day. It means I don't have set hours, just deadlines.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use AI everyday, mostly to improve my communications, including emails.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last email you drafted with AI, step by step, from your first prompt to sending it?

[USER]
I copy and pasted the email into ChatGPT then I asked for a small response and it gave me one. I edited it to my liking and used it.

[ASSISTANT]
In that email, what changes did you make to the AI’s draft before you sent it, and what led you to make those edits?

[USER]
I changed some words around and fixed the spelling. AI often makes errors, so it needs to be constantly edited.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example of an error it made in that draft and how you caught it?

[USER]
Yes, it hallucinated a fact about a company I was emailing. I had to correct it.

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when you spotted that mistake?

[USER]
"AI sucks" because it is mostly inaccurate. It still has use cases, but it is nowhere near as good of a tool as the techbros are hyping it up to be.

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it for messages now, how do you check the information before you hit send?

[USER]
I read through the entire message that AI gives me.

[ASSISTANT]
How has using it changed the time you spend on email compared to before?

[USER]
It allows me to spend less time on email, but also it just makes my communication sound more professional.

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond email, where else do you use it in your engineering or teaching work?

[USER]
It helps me grade student assignments. It also helps me code and find bugs in the code.

[ASSISTANT]
Take the grading first. Can you tell me about the last assignment you graded with help from AI, and exactly how you used it in that process?

[USER]
Yes, I graded essays. I would copy and paste parts of the essay into ChatGPT and just ask for it's opinion on what the grade should be based on the assignment prompt.

[ASSISTANT]
When it suggested a grade, how did you decide whether to accept it or change it?

[USER]
I used my own judgement and adjusted the grade up.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
AI makes my communication better in general, so I think it improves my working relationships.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific interaction where the clearer wording changed how the conversation went? What happened?

[USER]
Yes, I recently had a student email me that was having a hard time. I made sure the communication was kind, as well as professional. I think it really made a difference.

[ASSISTANT]
What did the student say in response, and how did it shape what happened next?

[USER]
The student was grateful for my support and it shaped the positive outcome.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Yes, anything art related or anything related to a final product. Human creativity cannot be replaced in my opinion and AI requires constant oversight. Nobody should be using anything AI outputs without reviewing it carefully first.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping the art and final product in your own hands important to you?

[USER]
Humans need to be valued higher than computers or there's no point to our existence.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled the art or the final product, how do you think that would change your role with your team or with your students?

[USER]
I think it would do a poor job with both and that would lead to major issues. I don't think it would change my role because I don't think it's capable of replacing what I do.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
summarizing things, like papers, books, emails, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes summarizing the kind of thing you’re comfortable handing over?

[USER]
It's really good at summarizing long amounts of text.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled the summarizing, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team or your class?

[USER]
No, I think summarizing just helps me be better at my jobs directly.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Autonomy means having the final say, the final approval. It means being able to change anything related to final communication, final product. It means AI is a tool to be used, an assistant to make you (the human) better at your job.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a recent example where you exercised that final say on a project or message, what you changed, and why it mattered to you to change it?

[USER]
Yes, I recently finished a small coding project. AI helped a lot, mostly with debugging. However, I had the final say on the overall design, the overall end project that I presented. I did change quite a bit that AI had suggested because it just wasn't what my human judgement said was correct. It mattered to me to change it because it made the end product much more me.

[ASSISTANT]
For someone new to your field, what habits would you recommend so they keep that final say when they use AI on a project?

[USER]
Always review all AI output very carefully. If you think something isn't right, change it. Use other resources, including other people, to make sure your end product is human-centered.

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might hear what you said. One is choosing the goals and the plan. The other is the final wording and design details. Which is closer to what you mean, or is it something else?

[USER]
Final wording and design details. Goals and plan is good to have obviously, but it's the end product that matters most.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
I think AI is a great tool. It definitely has use cases and can really improve workflows. It should not be used to replace humans completely. It isn't capable of doing so. It isn't human.

[ASSISTANT]
Is there anything else you’d like to add before we finish?

[USER]
I appreciate the conversation.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Duration: 28.94 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an application packager and remote access admin for a large oil firm

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
good pay, good bonus and pension, health care and good holiday allowance and flexible working

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about those elements, which one matters most to you right now, and why?

[USER]
good pay, it matters most as its why everyone works and currently with the affordability crisis we all need more money

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
i sue AI a lot to create scripts and code and to also check code i have written. i also use it for email generation

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it to create a script—what was the task, and what parts did it handle versus what you handled?

[USER]
i needed a deployment script in powershell that installed a piece of software with various installation  flags and pre-rquisite software checks and installs

[ASSISTANT]
In that case, what did you have the AI generate, and what did you write or modify yourself?

[USER]
i had it write the initial script and i then checked it and modified what was needing changed

[ASSISTANT]
Did it make any mistakes in that first draft, and if so, how did you handle them?

[USER]
yes it did, it used incorrect flags for this specific piece of software so i altered them and reran the AI so it knows the flags for it in future

[ASSISTANT]
When you spotted the incorrect flags, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
i was half expecting it as this isnt the first time ive had this issue. so it was simply "oh here we go"

[ASSISTANT]
After you fixed the flags and reran things, how confident were you in the script compared to if you had written it from scratch, and what made the difference for you?

[USER]
i was very confident, i would have been confident if i had done it as well just it took much less time to do and i didnt have to check for any syntax errors

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that script?

[USER]
i created documentation for the install and installer guide, which i  also used AI for

[ASSISTANT]
When you used it to create the documentation and installer guide, what did it produce for you, and what did you end up changing or adding yourself?

[USER]
i have a template i use and it is pretty straight forward, the AI fills it out generally very well and i only ever have to usually make minor adjustments to network paths or install flags\.ini files

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned using it for email generation too. Can you tell me about the last email you drafted with it and what you kept versus what you changed?

[USER]
i drafted an email to my boss asking for time off , i requested the AI id it with a business like tone. i only had to change a few things such as some of the phrasing wasn't very British and more in line with American phrasing

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re reviewing and tweaking its drafts, does it feel like you’re drawing on your expertise in a good way, or more like tedious cleanup work?

[USER]
im drawing on my experience in a good way but it can feel tedious. I do worry however that the next generation will lack the skills to tweak these things as they rely too much on AI for it

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to doing these tasks without it, how has your day-to-day workflow changed over a typical week?

[USER]
my workflow is very similar just much much faster.  I can get the documentation and scripts done and ready for testing in a much more streamlined way now

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time when using it backfired or created extra work for you, and what you did next?

[USER]
when i first started using it i was not as thorough with my checking of the scripting and this lead to a software deployment failing to 10,000 PCs. This also caused issue with some of them and another peice of software so i had to get a remediate script created and pushed out very quickly.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
it hasn't i don't think?  i still have the same relationship with my team mates and manager as i did before

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned that failed deployment earlier. How did that incident play out with your manager or your team?

[USER]
it lea to me getting quite a lot of playful ribbing for many months and it also lead our manager to add to the scripting process that all AI scripts have to be peer reviewed by a human prior to deployment

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
the actual deployment go or no go decision should always be by me as there are a lot of nuances to consider that i don't think AI could fully take into account. It can also affect tens of thousands of our PCs

[ASSISTANT]
Why is making that final go or no go call important for you to keep?

[USER]
because it can lead to major issues and time lost if it is done wrong or leads to a mistake

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI made that final call instead of you, how do you think it would change your role on the team or your relationships with others?

[USER]
i think i would be seen less of the go to man for deployments and more the guy who makes sure the AI hasn't made a mistake

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
remediating issues on users machines, if they could do that in the middle of the night so i don't have to it would be great also doing on call for me

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those nighttime remediation and on‑call tasks the ones you’d most want to hand over—what is it about them that you’d be glad to be rid of?

[USER]
they are anti-social times and also mean i am tied to my phone when on call and cant do much outwith work

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over those nighttime fixes and the on‑call rota, how do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
its part of the job that largely goes un-noticed anyway. i don't think people would have any different of a view

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
i would tell them that it is freedom to do a job how you feel is best without constraints . It may sometimes not be the correct way but that's how you learn, you learn from making mistakes

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice from your own work?

[USER]
An example is that many of my colleagues strictly follow a packaging recipe procedure that i helped create. But i don't follow it as strictly as they do as i have the autonomy to branch out if i want

[ASSISTANT]
When you decide not to follow the recipe strictly, what signals or cues tell you it’s the right call, and what safeguards do you use so it doesn’t backfire?

[USER]
the signals are a lot of the time instinct from years of doing the job and just knowing what works and what doesn't. The safeguards are we peer review each other's work so we have 2 sets of eyes on projects to ensure nothing "should" break

[ASSISTANT]
Tell me about a recent time when your judgment led you to override what the AI suggested or what the template would have you do—what happened and how did it turn out?

[USER]
A recent incident was AI creating a script that did not take into account that some machines  in the organisation had a pre-requisite piece of software but at a much older version. They had legacy software that relied on the older version of the  pre-requisite software. If we accidentally ran the scrip and updated them the legacy software would break and we would lose many man hours. I knew about these machines and remedied the script once the AI had created it

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Is there anything else about AI’s impact on your work that we haven’t covered that you’d like to add?

[USER]
nothing of note, it has been an interesting chat, thank you!

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Duration: 64.00 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an IT manager for a textile manufacturing company

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I think a good job means completing something in a way which means the tasks is fully completed and doesn't have to be revisited or corrected in the future

[ASSISTANT]
Besides getting something right the first time, what else matters to you when you think about a good job?

[USER]
I mean more a sense of once the job is complete, it is done to such a standard that you almost don't have to think about it anymore. Or that you do not have to go back to rework on it, or have someone else have to finish it for you. It should also show some kind of progress, after finishing a job well, there should be a feeling like you have "moved forwards"

[ASSISTANT]
When you say moved forwards, what does that look like in your role?

[USER]
So for me that could mean something like refreshing out computer hardware. If that is our job, once we have completed it, we can see the progress we have me

[ASSISTANT]
When a job is done well in your world, what do you notice in your day or from others that tells you it hit that standard?

[USER]
There is a feeling of satisfaction, definitely. Seeing others act grateful for the work you've done or give you approval can be very fulfilling and encouraging for me

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
The main impact of AI so far has been giving me more free time in the day to do more important managerial work. It feels like having an extra member of staff that I can give simple work to

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it at work and what specific task you handed over to it?

[USER]
Most recently I have been using it to scan our systems monitoring logs so that I don't have to do it myself in detail. It finds things like errors or odd activity and turns it into a summary for me to read, essentially

[ASSISTANT]
In that example with the monitoring logs, what parts did it handle and what parts did you still do yourself?

[USER]
I decided the data points that I wanted to monitor and set up the overall process initally and I also still personally review the summary and go into further depth if I think it is needed. The AI collects all of the data points and looks for anything unsual. It the turns that information into a fairly simple summary for me to rea

[USER]
read

[ASSISTANT]
Has it ever flagged something that turned out to be noise, or missed something important? What happened in that instance?

[USER]
Yes there has been examples of both although they are quite rare. It has flagged for irregularities  occasionally during data syncs that may take a bit longer than usual but I was able adjust the thresholds for detection and it seems to be working so far. The biggest miss so far was during a system backup in which it was reported as a "partial success" and the AI didn't detect that it was an error. We had to manually backup certain files after we noticed the gap, we then updated our prompt to try and avoid this in the future

[ASSISTANT]
When you discovered that backup miss, what went through your mind and how did you react in the moment?

[USER]
I felt quite surpised that it had missed it and it also made me think about how much more cautious I should be when using the AI in the future. It was a fairly minor issue that didn't take long to correct, but if it had missed something else it could've had much worse consequences

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about this past week, what did you do with the time you didn’t spend on detailed log review?

[USER]
Mainly planning for 2026 and working more closely with my team members. As a company we have been planning infrastructure upgrades for some time now, so having extra hours to properly focus and plan out the next year has been realy helpful. Especially when it comes to working with other departments

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond the log summaries, are there other parts of your job where you use it?

[USER]
I often use it for things like drafting emails or communication posts. It saves me a lot of time writing things from scratch every day. I also use it to review documents or contracts to highlight key things, again saving time. I have been using it more for planning recently too. I will give it rough ideas for projects and it is able to organize things in a way which makes them much easier to think through

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it to draft emails or posts, what do you usually keep as-is and what do you tend to rewrite yourself?

[USER]
Usually I will change the tone or certain words as AI always seems to have a particular way of writing. Even if it doesn't change the information, it makes it seem more human and less perfect. I also usually add some personal details that the AI won't know unless I give it specific instructions. I nearly always keep the same email structure as I think it does a superb job of that. I also don't tend to overly edit summaries as I think it is hard for me to improve them

[ASSISTANT]
When you hand these tasks over to it, do you feel more confident in the end result or less, and what makes you feel that way?

[USER]
I feel much more confident most of them time. I was skeptical initally but AI has been very consistent at giving me high quality responses, it is hard to deny how effective it is when used correctly. I am  still happy to work without it, but I definitely feel more secure when using it

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I think overall it has slightly improved them as I have more time and am less rushed than I was before. I feel more calm and relaxed so it can be very helpful to boost morale slightly. It has been very helpful when talking with other departments too as I can work at a faster pace and explain things to them in a clearer and more organized way when I use AI to help me

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent interaction with another department where using it changed how the conversation went? What stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
I was recently in contact with finance as they were having issues with their software and they had sent me a fairly long message explaining the problems they were having. Before I would have briefly skim read the message and most likely said I will come to see what was wrong at some unplanned part of the day when I was free. But I put the message into AI, asked it summarize the issues and concerns  and then make a response with some simple suggestions where it was appropriate. What stood out was how fast and easy the process was. Everything was so much faster and more efficient than if I had to do it all myself

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I wouldn't want the AI to be making final decision on big projects. As much as it can be helpful, I still think people should stay in charge of things like this. I would also not want AI to be involved in dealing with team members. If people are having issues or problems, I wouldn't want them to have to interact with an AI to fix them

[ASSISTANT]
What is important to you about keeping the final call on big projects?

[USER]
I think it is important that people are responsible overall. If AI makes the final call on a big project and it goes wrong, nobody can really learn or account for the mistakes being made

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI made the final call on a big project, how do you think that would change how your teammates see you or how you see your responsibilities?

[USER]
It would make me seem less responsible and trust worthy as a manager. If I was willing to let AI make choices like that, I would basically be making myself useless

[ASSISTANT]
When it comes to handling issues with your team members, what makes you want to keep those conversations human?

[USER]
I think it is important that these things are handled with empathy and understanding. I know that AI can in theory deal with emotional issues, but I think it is more appropriate for humans to interact with each other than rely on an AI

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Any type of log scanning, email drafting or document preparation. AI has shown it is very good at these tasks, so if I never had to do them again I would be happy

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those tasks good fits to hand over, from your point of view?

[USER]
They are things that AI is very good at and that can be done efficiently. It can take workers a long time to complete this kind of work

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over those tasks entirely, would it change how others see your contribution at work, or how you see what you bring to the team?

[USER]
I don't think so as this type of work is more about saving time than anything else

[ASSISTANT]
We have talked about your specific experiences. I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would say it is about having control over how you spend your time and how you choose to complete your work and solve problems

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your week of what that looked like in practice?

[USER]
So like I mentioned before with using AI to draft certain documents. I could choose to do that myself, but I think my time is better spent doing other things so I decide instead to use AI as a tool to complete the work

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might hear what you said. One is choosing your tools and methods day to day. The other is shaping which problems you work on and when. Which is closer to what you mean, or is it something else?

[USER]
Shaping which problems you work on, and deciding how you want to complete them

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
Overall it has been a positive thing for me. I was very skeptical and still use it with some caution, but I can't deny how useful it is in certain areas

[ASSISTANT]
Have we covered the important parts for you, or is there anything you want to add before we finish?

[USER]
I think thats all, thanks!

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

Duration: 41.08 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an IT Infrastructure architect

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Interesting, engaging, dynamic

[ASSISTANT]
When you say interesting, what makes a job interesting for you day to day? Could you share a recent moment that really fit that?

[USER]
I am a techy so even though I am an architect I like to engage with systems aevery once in a while

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a week that really felt dynamic in your work?

[USER]
A few weeks a go we had to uodate the firmware in our firewalls. When we do that the IIS servers  will at times not failover via the load balancers. When this haooens we need people on task to reboot and reset the load balancers. It is a literal ballet between the firewall reboots and the IIS resets.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say engaging, what draws you in or keeps you invested during a day like that?

[USER]
I have always said that our job is to be invisible. If we do or jobs right then no one will know we are doing it. We had zero downtime and we orchestrated to perfection How can you di that and not be engaged?

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It helps me a bit, I am involvedin very parge projects and one of my duties is to present executive briefs to the execuvite staff. Ai is able to take a large project and sum it up in just a paragraph or two. it would take m a logn time to do that

[ASSISTANT]
In that last executive brief you mentioned, what did you ask the AI to do, and what did you handle yourself?

[USER]
It was an unfirtunate situaiton, we had to fire the vnedor and put it on hold. I had to roll up the projects current status, the problems with the vendor and the new timeline. It woukd ahve taken my half a day,  AI had it done within minutes and after I sanity checked it I was able to get it turned in on time

[ASSISTANT]
When you reviewed that draft, was there anything the AI got wrong or missed, and how did you handle those parts?

[USER]
It was wordy and had repeated a little bit of info so i cleaned it up and got it turned in, I probably didn;t have to do it but it was slightly cleaner

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when you saw the AI’s first pass at that summary?

[USER]
I was happy, it was really good and took only a little clean up

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that brief?

[USER]
I am busy so I did other work.. I also had ot wind down the project and debrief my team.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to how you used to write these briefs without AI, what felt most different about your process that day?

[USER]
It was fast and efficient, I am very good at doing them but it takes me some time to do so because I am very careful. It is for executive staff so it is important to be correct the first time

[ASSISTANT]
Are there other parts of your work where you use AI?

[USER]
When I create PP presentations I have CoPilot create images at times and I am getting better at it

[ASSISTANT]
When you use Copilot for presentation images, what do you usually ask it to make, and what parts do you end up tweaking yourself?

[USER]
Peoplwith charts to illustrate effort, I hav ebeen experimenting with having it create tables withh data that I give it

[ASSISTANT]
When you have it turn your data into a table, how often does it get the structure or numbers wrong, and what do you do when that happens?

[USER]
Not veryt often but they are simple, i am starting simple

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
Not at all

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
We embrace andsupply CoPilot to our users

[ASSISTANT]
Got it. Is there any task you personally would want to keep in your own hands, even if an AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Porbably with respect to logs and reports, I do it a little bit now but just experimenting

[ASSISTANT]
Why is working with logs and reports something you’d want to keep in your own hands? What makes that important to you?

[USER]
I'm just not good at getting it through AI yet I'm working on it

[ASSISTANT]
When you go through logs or reports yourself, what are you watching for that you prefer to judge with your own eyes?

[USER]
anomalies and if I'm going through several different system logs and reports I'm looking for correlations and I think I is better for that than I am it certainly is faster

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled that correlation work end to end, how do you think it would change your role on the team?

[USER]
It would not change my role. I was just use it as a tool.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I think the reports and logs are important. I think the way we deployed as it would create the documentation for me, sort of filter it down to the important stuff.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes it appealing to have AI do that filtering and documentation for reports and logs?

[USER]
Honestly, I think it can do a better job. I think it will miss a lot less than I do. As a matter fact I don't think I'll miss anything at all

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over more of that filtering and documentation, would it change how your teammates or leaders see what you contribute?

[USER]
I don't think so, in tech it's always better to work smart than hard. While we are not embracing it 100% right now it will be in the future and I don't wanna fall behind. I've been in this business most of my life 30 years or so and I have not fallen behind yet.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I think you rise to a certain level of trust and respect with your peers and your supervisors, managers, etc. and when you know your job, your trusted to just do it. They give you a task and just expected to get done that to me as autonomy and I've had that for so many years of my career that I'm not sure what it would be like to have a micromanager.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a recent example of being handed a task with that level of trust, and walk me through the key decisions you made without checking in?

[USER]
I pretty much do that every day being that I am the infrastructure architect, and the lead engineer. They give me a problem to solve, I talk to my guys about it, and we present the solution to the executive staff. They don't really know what they're looking at, but they give approval.... Normally, I have a deadline and as long as I make that deadline, no one bothers me. I don't have anyone telling me how to do it, that's actually my job.

[ASSISTANT]
In that last problem you led, can you walk me through one trade-off you had to weigh and how you decided which way to go?

[USER]
We are moving everything from our race floor into the cloud, but we do have some programs that require on site storage since our enterprise storage was all going to cloud I just needed a very inexpensive solution to keep on the floor. The choice we had to make prior to that is do we force everybody into the cloud or do we keep something on prem, and then back it up to the cloud. We have a department that creates a tremendous amount of very large files, images, etc. having them come into the office and upload to the cloud would've taken too long so we just have them drop it onto the on premise storage that we create a solution for. Then it backs up, so we still have it in the cloud, but it's done at night when the customer is not affected.

[ASSISTANT]
For someone new coming into your field, what would you tell them to do—or avoid—so they can earn that level of trust today, especially with AI in the mix?

[USER]
raised floor

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for clarifying that. Before we wrap up, is there anything we haven’t talked about regarding how AI is affecting your work that you want to add?

[USER]
Not realy I think. we covered alot

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. Is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

Thank you very much for your answers!

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a chef

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A good job involves completing the work that is asked of you

[ASSISTANT]
Besides completing what’s asked of you, what else matters most to you in a job?

[USER]
Knowing that I have satisfied the customer

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about days you leave work proud, what made those days good?

[USER]
Well, simply because I know that I'm not just phoning it in, droning along, day after day

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
Well, I've heard a lot of talk about using AI to start doing things like stock checks, stock predictions, orders, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
Have you personally used any AI tools so far in your kitchen, or has it mostly been conversations about possibly using them?

[USER]
mostly the latter

[ASSISTANT]
Has anything in your day-to-day changed yet because of these discussions, even small things like how you plan or coordinate?

[USER]
no, not hugely. Just a lot of talk

[ASSISTANT]
When you hear all that talk, what goes through your mind about bringing these tools into a kitchen like yours?

[USER]
I'm torn - on the one hand, I can absolutely see how it could be useful. I wonder though how much faffing about and learning will be involved before it can actually be functional/useful

[ASSISTANT]
If you were to try it on one small task first, which task would you pick, and what would you hope it actually does for you in that situation?

[USER]
I'd probably use it to track inventory or do inventory predictions -then come back after a week, do my own stock take, and see if it matches up

[ASSISTANT]
In that pilot you described, which parts would you want the tool to handle, and what would you keep in your own hands?

[USER]
I think you need to elaborate, I don't understand

[ASSISTANT]
Could you walk me through, step by step, how you imagine that trial would run from start to finish, and where you’d step in along the way?

[USER]
It'd be simple, I would just plug some data from the prior weeks about how much stock we're using into the AI, maybe also my own predictions about how many covers we do in a week, things like that

[ASSISTANT]
If the numbers the tool suggested didn’t line up with your stock take, what would you do next?

[USER]
I'd immediately cancel the AI usage

[ASSISTANT]
What would you need to see in that first week to decide it’s worth keeping?

[USER]
I'd need to see seriously impressive results

[ASSISTANT]
When you say “seriously impressive,” what does that mean in practice for you—what concrete signs or results would convince you to keep it?

[USER]
It'd need to be near perfect results

[ASSISTANT]
When you picture trusting it with ordering decisions for a week, what’s your gut response?

[USER]
I think now that AI has advanced a bit, it definitely could produce results. Ultimately I'd have to see it in action.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to how you handle inventory today, how do you imagine your day-to-day would change if the tool actually worked as you hope?

[USER]
I think it would make it much easier, because I wouldn't have to do stock takes and I wouldn't have to be constantly on top of how much of what we need to order

[ASSISTANT]
If it did make a bad call on quantities one week, how would that show up in your kitchen, and who would notice first?

[USER]
well I'd notice that we don't have enough of a given foodstuff, presumablt

[ASSISTANT]
What stands out to you about the idea of not doing stock takes anymore—what would that shift feel like for you during a typical week?

[USER]
It'd give me a bit more free time for other things

[ASSISTANT]
If you had to step in and correct its numbers, what would that be like for you—more like using your craft to fine-tune things, or more like tedious cleanup work?

[USER]
the latter definitely

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
it hasn't, thus far

[ASSISTANT]
Even if nothing has changed yet, have the conversations about it with your team or managers shifted expectations or dynamics in any way?

[USER]
not really in any meaningful way

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
well, the cooking itself would be the main thing

[ASSISTANT]
What makes the cooking itself the part you want to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
cooking is an art - also a matter of health and safety

[ASSISTANT]
Which moments in the cooking process matter most for you to do yourself?

[USER]
all of it

[ASSISTANT]
If a machine handled the cooking, how do you think that would change your relationships with your team or your role on the line?

[USER]
my role wouldn't really exist, but it's a moot point, because that would never be allowed

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
cleaning, probably. and like i said before, the stock takes

[ASSISTANT]
Why those tasks in particular—what makes cleaning or stock takes the ones you’d want to hand over first?

[USER]
they are drone work, they're important obviously, but there's not really any need for human involvement if the AI can successfully handle the tasks. Obviously, I'm not exactly sure how AI would clean (or cook, for that matter) but if it could be done then why not

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them that ultimately, autonomy can't really come unless you are running a kitchen, or better, you own your own restaurant

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice—what decisions you get to make when you’re running the kitchen, versus when you’re not?

[USER]
well when you're running the kitchen - you're setting the menu, you have the final say on plating, basically you get the final call on every aspect of cooking

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent service when you made a final call on something like the menu or plating, and walk me through what happened and how you decided?

[USER]
I mean I built the menu for the restaurant I work at, what more is there to say

[ASSISTANT]
What’s one dish on that menu where you made a call others might have done differently, and what guided your decision?

[USER]
I decided that baked alaska would be fired in the kitchen, as opposed to at table

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting or might affect your work?

[USER]
nothing I can think to add

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights today.

Date: 12/12/2025 18:06:17
Duration: 55.87 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hello, I'm a data engineer and automation specialist

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I think it matters a lot whether you like what you do and whether your role allows you to work on what you like. Also, of extremely importance is the environment and management which should make you feel appreciated and work with calm without being excessively pressured

[ASSISTANT]
When you say working on what you like, what kinds of problems or projects give you energy? Can you share an example?

[USER]
I like working on something end to end, especially if it is a solution that I proposed or thought of. For example last year I came up with an idea to automate some internal activities we have to do every time there is a holiday event. I proposed it, developed it, tuned it and improved it. And everybody loves it

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about feeling appreciated and being able to work with calm, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
I'm happy when someone in the team appreciates what I'm doing and recognises my effort and good work, like for example mentioning something that I did well during our daily stand-up. Also, I like to work in an environment that gives me the time and resources needed to do my job in the best possible way. Quality is better than quantity in my opinion

[ASSISTANT]
If you had to pick the single most important ingredient that makes a job good for you, what would it be, and why?

[USER]
Strong company values which make an environment relaxed and pleasant

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I have recently started a new adventure as I'm learning how to develop Copilots

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last Copilot you worked on, step by step?

[USER]
I've just started and I'm working on my first Copilot agent. It will be a Copilot agent to help our team automating some internal activities. The first use case is to generate a release plan and posting it to a Teams channel, the agent will first gather some required information from the user

[ASSISTANT]
In that workflow, which parts will the agent handle and which parts do you expect to do yourself?

[USER]
That should be, if it works as expected, all handled by the agent. Of course than the user will interact with the release plan and make changes to it

[ASSISTANT]
What information does it need to collect to draft the release plan, and where will it pull that information from?

[USER]
For now it will just need some basic information such as which product the release is for and what version number it is so it knows how to name the plan and the tasks properly. In the future I might enhance it to also schedule tasks, assign them to people, populate calendars etc, but for now this is not needed

[ASSISTANT]
Before starting this project, how did you and your team create and share a release plan without an agent—what were the steps?

[USER]
It was all manual, in Teams a new channel was manually created, then add a tab to it, choose Planner app, create a new plan and add manually all the release tasks

[ASSISTANT]
Since this is your first agent, what has it been like to design it so far—what stands out to you about the experience?

[USER]
It's not very easy  because I'm missing the experience, which I'm hoping to build up as I proceed, but as it is quite a simple use case I'm proceeding pretty well so far. What I don't know very well for now are the best practices

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re unsure about best practices, what do you do to figure things out—where are you looking for guidance, and what has helped most so far?

[USER]
I'm googling and using ChatGpt, however I'm not always find the best information, as many times what applies to others doesn't apply to your use case

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent moment when the guidance you found didn’t fit your situation, and what you did next to get it working?

[USER]
Part of the automation required to call an API to pin the newly created plan to a Teams tab. Microsoft changed the way this API endpoint works, with very little official documentation on what values to provide to it. Information on the internet  and on ChatGpt was so confusing as everybody was saying a different thing, information was outdated, etc., only one version of the information was right, which I just found today after a few days of frustration.

[ASSISTANT]
When you finally found the version that worked today, what went through your mind?

[USER]
I was so happy, I kind of already gave up and accepted a compromise as I previously found a solution that didn't do what I wanted but it was close enough. This morning I found a recent post and I decided to give it the last go. That worked, I'm happy I tried

[ASSISTANT]
Once this agent is in place, how do you expect your release days to feel different compared to the fully manual way you described?

[USER]
It won't be a game changer as it will just saves a few minutes of manual work, but it's the first of probably a long list, so no matter how helpful it is, the important thing is to have it published so that we can start using it for other things as well

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It didn't affect any relationships, for now it is just helping optimising processes

[ASSISTANT]
What conversations have you had with your teammates or managers about introducing this agent?

[USER]
I know we are planning to have a customer facing virtual agent in a year or so, so as I'm already familiar with the Power Platform family it seemed like a good idea to expand my knowledge on Copilot, so I took the opportunity and volunteered for the future project, informing them that it would be beneficial for me to start gaining some knowledge on some easier internal agents.

[ASSISTANT]
What response did you get from your manager and teammates when you volunteered to take this on?

[USER]
They seemed pleased with me volunteering

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I believe that somebody should keep an eye on what AI would and could do in the future, so I would want to have a supervisory role on AI solutions. Also, I wouldn't handle our customer's data over to AI

[ASSISTANT]
What makes that supervisory role important for you to keep?

[USER]
A sense of control, I want to be able to switch off the solution, or to make changes to it, or checking if it's doing what's been built for

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI were doing the oversight itself, how do you think that would change your role on the team?

[USER]
I would not allow that to happen I think

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned not handing customer data over. What concerns are top of mind for you there?

[USER]
Customers pay us to protect their data, I want to have control over what it is happening to it. An AI system could use or misuse data or interpret it wrongly.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
For example in today's example, I would have liked that a reliable AI system produced the correct code for me to use in that API action, while ChatGPT failed to do that, it just gave me a lot of different versions of it, all wrong, making me waste a lot of time time. At the end the right solution I found it myself on a specific post on the internet.

[ASSISTANT]
What would make a code‑generating assistant trustworthy enough for you to lean on it?

[USER]
First of all, making sure that is up to date with all the latest versions of software, APIs and components

[ASSISTANT]
If an assistant could generate correct, up‑to‑date code for you, would that change how others see your contribution on the team, and in what way?

[USER]
I don't think they would see me differently, as anyway I'm the one who needs to know how to use that code, how to generate the logic, how to design your workflow in the way that it works for us.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
To me it means to be able to choose how to do your job, having the freedom to propose alternative solutions or ways of working and having someone open to listen to your creative ideas and happy to support you to pursue them

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of a time when you chose your own way of doing the job, and walk me through what happened and how it played out?

[USER]
It happened many times, when I proposed some changes to my daily routines, I started only dealing with data, and then I proposed to become an automation specialist, now I'm also travelling towards virtual agents

[ASSISTANT]
When you moved from data work into automation and now toward virtual agents, what conversations or approvals were needed, and how did you navigate them?

[USER]
I explained how the new technologies could benefit the team, giving them real examples and showing them real POCs. They always liked those ideas so didn't need special approvals, just requiring the licences needed.

[ASSISTANT]
I can see two ways someone might hear what you said. One is being free to choose tools and methods on your own. The other is being able to set the direction of the work itself, like proposing new areas to build. Which one fits better for you, or is it something else?

[USER]
I'm a bit of both, I like to choose the tools and methods and also like to propose ideas and new areas to build, I don't think one excludes the other

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for taking the time and sharing these experiences. Is there anything we haven’t covered about how AI is affecting your work that you want to add?

[USER]
No I don't think so, thanks for the chat

[ASSISTANT]

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hello, I am a software engineer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Competitive pay and career growth opportunity

[ASSISTANT]
When you say career growth opportunity, what does that look like in practice for you?

[USER]
I can learn new things and improve myself

[ASSISTANT]
Day to day, what makes you feel like a job is good? What tells you you’re in the right place?

[USER]
Day-to-day, a good job makes me feel valued when my contributions are recognized. I feel in the right place when I enjoy the team work and make great achievement

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI helps me to improve my productivity

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent task where you used it, and what you used it for specifically?

[USER]
I describe my tasks to AI and let AI help to write the scripts to automate the tasks

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did the AI produce, and which parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
I need to describe the tasks steps by steps to AI to let AI knows the requirements. AI produce the scripts to automate these steps. Then I validated the scripts

[ASSISTANT]
Did the scripts have any mistakes or gaps when you first tried them out? If so, what did you do next?

[USER]
Yes, AI missed some steps during the first try. I gave AI further instructions to let AI add these missing steps

[ASSISTANT]
When it missed those steps on the first run, what went through your mind?

[USER]
I thought it was normal

[ASSISTANT]
When you were reviewing and fixing those scripts, what did that feel like to you?

[USER]
When I saw those mistakes got fixed, I felt good and thought this was a good collaboration with AI

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to doing those automations without it, how did the process feel different for you?

[USER]
Compared to the process without AI help, I took more time to complete such tasks. With AI's help, this task was completed with faster speed and took less time.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that task?

[USER]
I took more tasks and made more achievements

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
In my team, AI helps us to more efficient and more productivity

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific interaction with a teammate where AI played a role in how you worked together? What happened?

[USER]
This was the example that my teammate and I worked together to debug a bug. We investigated the bug individually and discussed together with what our findings and made the possible lists of the reasons to cause the bug. We then gave AI those information and identified the issue and fixed it

[ASSISTANT]
When AI suggested the likely issue, how did you and your teammate decide whether to trust it?

[USER]
We tried the suggestions that AI gave and made some changes based on it and then validated the fix

[ASSISTANT]
Has using it changed how you and your manager talk about problem solving or expectations for your work?

[USER]
Yes

[ASSISTANT]
In what way have those conversations with your manager changed? Can you walk me through a recent one?

[USER]
With AI's help, we use less time to handle the routine technical issues and put more time on the higher level strategic problems

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Yes, even though AI can execute the technology code perfectly, I believe that the core responsibility of defining the human value should be handled by us instead of AI

[ASSISTANT]
Why is defining human value something you want to keep in your own hands? What makes that part meaningful to you?

[USER]
Because I think it is my ethical responsibility and it is meaningful to me because it allows me to determine the positive impact on society

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI started making those calls about human value, how do you think that would change your role on the team or your relationships with others at work?

[USER]
If an AI started making those calls about human value, I think I will change to a validator instead of a creator

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would happily let AI help to do some automated and time consuming tasks

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those automated and time consuming tasks the ones you want to hand over?

[USER]
It can help me to higher productivity and more time on the strategic problems

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a recent example of a time‑consuming task you’d hand over, and what you would do with the time you’d free up?

[USER]
Previously I need to spend a lot of time to covert my data from one format to another format. Now AI helps to handle those tasks very quickly. I can spend more time on the strategic problems and directions for my team.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them as a software engineer having autonomy means you control how to implement the tasks and complete the tasks with AI help.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from a recent project of what that looks like in practice?

[USER]
The recent project was that I need to implement an automated validation for our new feather added for the customer. I got approval from my manager and described the validated steps to AI. AI helped to generate the automation scripts and I validated those scripts

[ASSISTANT]
In that project, which decisions were fully yours to make and which were set by your manager or team standards?

[USER]
My manager approved the task to automatedly  validate the new feature and I was fully responsible for how to validate the feature

[ASSISTANT]
When you decided how to validate that feature, what limits did you have to follow and where did you get to set your own approach?

[USER]
I need to follow the limitation to validate the feature by input valid parameters and get the valid output. I got those based on the customers requirement

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
I think AI makes great helps with my work, but I also worry about the environmental effects that AI made

[ASSISTANT]
I hear you on the environmental concern, and it’s an important one. Is there anything else you’d like to add about how it’s affecting your work before we close?

[USER]
That's all. Thanks

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

[USER]
4

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks so much for your time and thoughtful answers. I appreciate you sharing concrete examples from your work and your perspective on where this is all heading. If anything new comes up down the line, I’d be glad to hear from you.

Duration: 41.53 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I manage the company data and database

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. What does a typical week look like for you in that role, and what kinds of responsibilities are on your plate?

[USER]
a typical week would entiles analysing data for marketing purposes or managing various queries related to data from my colleagues

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
being very detailed oriented and extremely good at analysis

[ASSISTANT]
When you think of a good job, what makes it satisfying for you day to day?

[USER]
receiving good feedback from my colleagues is very sadisfying, as they need data to do their job

[ASSISTANT]
What helps you do your best work?

[USER]
be very calm and patient helps because the job is often quite stressful

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I sometimes use AI to organise my tasks and do some coding and data analysis

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it for coding or data analysis, and walk me through what you did step by step?

[USER]
That was about 10 days ago. I was asked to do an analysis report on a past campaign for a director. I entered the data into AI and let it do the report, giving the specification from the director

[ASSISTANT]
In that report, what parts did the AI generate, and what did you handle yourself?

[USER]
I handled the criteria and AI handled the rest, according to the specs provided

[ASSISTANT]
When the AI produced the draft, how did you review it, and what did you end up changing before sending it to the director?

[USER]
I didn't have to change anything, as the report only highlighted the top level data, which was quite straighforward indeed

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind when you saw the AI’s report was ready to send as is?

[USER]
I was extremely grateful, as I had no time whatsoever to make any amendments. That week was very full on busy and the request for the report came without any notice

[ASSISTANT]
How would you have handled that kind of report before using AI, and what would have been different for you in terms of steps and time?

[USER]
I would have had 2 choices: either request a day to produce the report or change the tasks' order I had for that day, prioritising the director's request

[ASSISTANT]
Have there been times when the output from AI was off in some way, and if so, how did you spot it and what did you do next?

[USER]
never had that issue, as I always make sure the specs is crystal clear and only use very straighforward and cleaned data

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned also using AI to organise your tasks. Can you tell me about a recent time you did that and how it changed your day?

[USER]
This is something I do every beginning of the month: I anticipate the routine tasks and also try to anticipate various requests for work, such as data analysis reports and various queries. I also know how much I need to invest on each task. It makes my life so  uch easier when I roughfly know what a work day will look like and how much I'd have left for additional work, if needed

[ASSISTANT]
When the planning or reporting goes faster with AI, what do you usually do with the time that frees up?

[USER]
I usually review the very many process documentations and the various webpages, making sure that they are updated with the lates version/tool. I also train new member of staff in the use of our database, which is mandatory. I also sometimes help with admin tasks - mainly HR related

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It has massivly improved it, as I am now able to dedicate more time helping with IT related tasks - something most colleagues need help with. I also feel much happier as I can - if I need or wish to - delegate routine and mundane tasks to AI, which also improve on the accuracy of what I deliver

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent interaction with a colleague or your director where using AI changed how that conversation or handoff went? What stands out to you about it?

[USER]
Generally speaking, the delivery of my work are now faster and more accurate. The report mentioned earlier would have taken me at least 1/2 day to produce, whereas it only took me 2 hours. The director was well pleased and also able to provide up to date information to the board meeting, which in turns pleased all the other senior executives

[ASSISTANT]
Has using AI changed what your manager or colleagues expect from you in terms of speed, quality, or availability?

[USER]
not really. The environment I work is very fast-paced anyway. What has changed is my ability to perform more tasks for different people

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
managing very sensitive data. that's something I don't feel confident about sharing with AI. It's also not allowed by company policy yet

[ASSISTANT]
Why is handling those sensitive datasets something you want to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
because they are kept in stick confidential manner and I occasionally need to delegate tasks to colleagues that involve sharing the location to such data. That's allowed, but the company forbid me from sharing that dataset with AI, as a data britch would be of cathastrofic consequences

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI were to handle those sensitive datasets instead of you, what do you think would change in your relationships with teammates or in your role on the team?

[USER]
nothing would change if the company change its policy - that's out of my hands

[ASSISTANT]
What would need to be true about an AI system for you to feel comfortable involving it with highly sensitive material?

[USER]
i am already confident about this. this is not an issue of confidence - well, not on my part. It's about the confidence or willingness of the board of trustees. this is decided at their level

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
most of it lol. AI is capable of extraordinary things at a speed I can only dream about. I wouldn't have any issue giving AI more tasks, but at the moment that's not a necessity

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have “autonomy” in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I'd tell them that autonomy is something you need to work hard to gain. Autonomy goes together with experience, hard work, skills and understanding.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your own job of what that looks like in practice?

[USER]
I manage many projects

[ASSISTANT]
Could you pick one recent project and walk me through a moment where you made a call without checking with anyone first—what the situation was, what you decided, and whether AI played a part?

[USER]
I PM all the technical projecyt of the company, so what you are asking is my daily bread. I set up, draft and delegate tasks for every single data related project in the company, managing 25 individuals. I also manage and approve the execusion of each tasks and ove the project along, dealing with issues on the way as well. I do at least 90% of my work in complete autonomy

[ASSISTANT]
When you are deciding whether to make a call yourself or bring someone else in, what tells you it is yours to decide?

[USER]
can you rephrase that

[ASSISTANT]
How do you tell a decision is one you can make on your own versus one you should escalate or check with someone else?

[USER]
the fact I am at the top of my department. my line manager has no technical or/and data related skills whatsoever, so those are mine and my decisions alone. Sometimes are the wrong ones, but I am paid to make those tough calls

[ASSISTANT]
Think back to a recent project milestone. What was a specific call you made on your own, and what stands out to you about how you reached it?

[USER]
A recent project milestones was the introduction of AI :)) What made it stands out was that I could quite easily demonstrate the huge benefit introducing AI would bring to my department and the company as a whole. It was a long and convoluted analysis, but I eventually produced a very detailed report that highlighted the individual benefits and the ROI for the whole company as well

[ASSISTANT]
With AI in the mix, what tells you a newcomer is ready to be trusted to run with a task on their own?

[USER]
a new comer will need to shadow a more experience person for at least 3 months before they are left in charge of important tasks

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI has changed your work or how it might change it going forward?

[USER]
AI has changed they way I work in a way I myself didn't anticipate. What I am a bit worried about is the easy with which newcomers wish to rely on it, not paying too much attention to their own personal development and skill building first. I fear that this is going to get worst going forward, but likely I won't be part of it, as I would be likely retired.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing that. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
It has giving me plenty of pleasure, as I have been able to think outside the box more often. AI is often bold and gives up the opportunity to explore and think about doing stuff in different ways, which helped with productivity

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. Have we covered everything important about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
I think so

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work). Please only reply with the associated number.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for taking the time to share your experiences. Your insights were clear and very helpful. If anything else comes to mind later, feel free to add it.

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work in Fiber Optics

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, thinking generally rather than about your own role?

[USER]
Being honest and caring about what you're giving or providing to customers. Ambitious and wanting better for the employees and the company itself

[ASSISTANT]
When you say being honest and caring, what does that look like in a day-to-day interaction with a customer?

[USER]
The customer should feel like you care about them and what you are doing for them. They should be able to trust you

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about being ambitious and wanting better for employees and the company, what does that look like in practice where you work?

[USER]
Not being stagnant. Giving your employees something to look forward to and to work towards something that gives them meaning

[ASSISTANT]
Of the things you’ve mentioned, which one feels most important to you right now, and why?

[USER]
Ambition. This is what fuels the workers and gives them a reason to want to work hard and diligently for you outside of a paycheck

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI impacts my work in a positive way. It helps us stay organized with our customers and support as well. Cleans up our schedule, makes other parts of our work easier to deal with

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent time when it helped you stay organized with a customer, step by step? What did you do and what did it do?

[USER]
It pretty much helps us everyday with customers. We get a pretty long list of customers who need tech support. AI helps us manage them by giving us whats a priority, whats not a priority, how far away the customer is so we can group them together, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
When it suggests priorities and groups customers, what do you do with those suggestions, and what decisions are still on you?

[USER]
I will prioritze them by who is a priority and needs to be seen ASAP versus the other customers. So basically whoever is getting prioritized, I will see them sooner than the others

[ASSISTANT]
Has it ever suggested a priority or grouping that you disagreed with? What happened in that instance?

[USER]
Not really, the AI does a good job now understanding critical issues versus ones that arent so important.

[ASSISTANT]
When you look at its list at the start of the day, what goes through your mind?

[USER]
Nowadays, I normally just focus on the list and can expect the people who need to be priotized on the top.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking back to before you had it, how does your day feel different now when you handle that queue and routing?

[USER]
It makes my work mornings a lot easier by allowing me to quickly go through the list, so I can prepare my equipment for the customers

[ASSISTANT]
Before you head out to the first site, what checks do you still do yourself on the list or the tickets?

[USER]
The list contains the customers phone number, name, and address. I will check the list to make sure that the customers on my list are also on the quickest route to their location

[ASSISTANT]
Have you ever noticed it giving incorrect or outdated info on a ticket, and if so, what did you do next?

[USER]
There have been times where their physical address hasnt been correct. The AI will give us coordinates on where their location is, and it hasnt been completely spot on at times

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized the coordinates were off, what did you do next?

[USER]
I manually checked the coordinates via Google earth. I also refer to the techs who works on the more technical side of AI, and they will try to correct its behavior

[ASSISTANT]
When you first noticed the location was wrong, what went through your mind?

[USER]
I start to realize that AI is not perfect and that I need to be more diligent and manually check their information that they are giving me

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
In reference to my relationship with colleagues? No real affect, outside of it gives us something to discuss

[ASSISTANT]
Has it changed anything in how your manager sets expectations for pace, response times, or what “a good day” looks like for your team?

[USER]
Yes. Since we have started using AI more, leadership does believe that we should be getting more installs or repairs done during the day since we have more time to focus on it.

[ASSISTANT]
What was your gut response when leadership raised the targets?

[USER]
It made me want to blame AI for giving leadership an excuse to give us more work to do.

[ASSISTANT]
After that reaction, did you bring it up with your manager or your team, or did it change how you went about your day?

[USER]
I didnt bring it up, but it did change how my work day goes, since now I have to spend more time putting equipment in my vehicle and having to carry more equipment around

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I wouldnt want AI to be doing the installs or repairs, atleast the physical part

[ASSISTANT]
Why is the physical part important for you to keep?

[USER]
Because this is what keeps us employed. If the AI are doing physical repairs and installs, there is no need for technicians anymore

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over the physical installs and repairs, how do you think that would change your role on the team or your relationships with coworkers and clients?

[USER]
It would completely change my role because I would likely be let go, and will no longer be their colleague

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Customer and over phone support.

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up customer and phone support?

[USER]
Our clients can be very difficult to deal with and not very understanding as to why their internet is down or not working properly. Dealing with rude customers is very common in this business and it becomes overwhelming

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled the customer and phone support, do you think it would change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
Not likely, since it would also be effecting them as well since we all have to do it

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them that autonomy can be a great idea and contributor to what you are doing by doing the more easier and repetitive task so that you can focus more on the imporant aspects of work. But don't completely trust it, check manually and make sure its working correctly for you.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a concrete example of when it took a repetitive task off your plate and let you focus on something more important, and walk me through what each of you did?

[USER]
It helps with screening calls and preparing/organizing our schedule, list of clients, etc. It allowed me to focus more on the customers and their issues

[ASSISTANT]
In that call‑screening and scheduling example, what choices did you still make yourself, and what was already set by the system?

[USER]
Sometimes I will filter the schedule out by where the customers are located, is it along the way, which ones are furtherst away from me.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say do not completely trust it, what is your rule of thumb for when to double check versus when to just go with what it suggests?

[USER]
Our AI has been having some issues with locating the exact location of some of our customers. This is important to us since a lot of our customers live in the mountains and are very hard to track down just by using their physical address.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t talked about yet?

[USER]
No thanks.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Duration: 37.75 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an IT Director for a group of small startup companies.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Work-life balance is crucial. Knowing that your work is appreciated also helps people feel their efforts are worth it. Competitive compensation packages are important as well.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say work‑life balance, what does that look like for you on a typical day or week?

[USER]
I would say that a company can expect an employee to work hard during work hours, and even put in extra effort. However, expecting employees to work extra hours on a consistent basis is unreasonable. High-stress jobs where you're thinking about work while you're with your family are not ideal.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about knowing your work is appreciated, what lets you know that in practice? What tells you it’s landing the way it should?

[USER]
Recognition from my manager and senior management, whether that be publicly in front of others, or even just calling or emailing me individually to congratulate me on a job well done.

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about competitive compensation packages, what elements matter most to you?

[USER]
Salary, retirement benefits, medical coverage.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
Before we go further, I'd like to ask, is this study specifically only for people who live in the UK? The study didn't specifically exclude US participants, but it seems you might only be interested in UK workers.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for checking. Your perspective is welcome regardless of where you’re based, and US experiences are very much of interest here.

Can you tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
OK, thanks. I use AI for a variety of tasks. I use it to summarize meeting notes for later recall. I can also use it to catch me up on what happens in meetings if I join late. I've used it to summarize long documents to give me the highlights. I use it to generate code, giving me small scripts to run, saving time when I have repetitive tasks to do.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about the small scripts you mentioned, can you walk me through the last time you used AI to generate one and tell me which parts it did and which parts you handled yourself?

[USER]
Someone asked me if I could automate moving data from an Excel spreadsheet. It required a long list of conditional parameters that would have taken me a long time to parse through and generate on my own. Instead, I used AI (I think I used Claude specifically for this one) to generate the code and it worked flawlessly. The AI generated all the code. I only copy and pasted it to execute it and created a button in the workbook for easy execution.

[ASSISTANT]
When you ran that script the first time and saw it work, what went through your mind?

[USER]
I was somewhat surprised at how well it was able to parse and interpret my prompt. Part of me was proud of myself for creating such a well articulated prompt that the AI could interpret everything correctly. Another part of me was impressed at how accurate the AI was and how well-commented the code it generated was.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to how you would have done that task without AI, how did the process and your pace differ this time?

[USER]
Without AI, I would have created the code one step at a time, tested that step, then move to the next step. It would have probably taken me hours. With AI, the code was generated in minutes. It took me longer to write the prompt than it did for AI to spit back the code to me.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that task?

[USER]
I moved on to the next task in my queue. It made me more productive, essentially.

[ASSISTANT]
Have there been times when the code or outputs from AI missed the mark for you? If so, what did you do next?

[USER]
Yes. Sometimes, there would be just a small error in the code that I could just manually fix myself. Other times, I would go back and refine the prompt and have the AI regenerate the code.

[ASSISTANT]
When you use AI to summarize meeting notes, what do you feed it and what do you personally review or tweak before you rely on the summary?

[USER]
We use Microsoft Teams, so we just enable recording and Copilot generates the meeting notes for us automatically. I typically skim through the meeting notes to make sure I don't see any major problems, but as a general rule I trust that the notes are accurate and file them.

[ASSISTANT]
When you join a meeting late and use the AI to catch you up, how does that change how you participate for the rest of the meeting?

[USER]
In the past, I would feel a bit awkward speaking up because I wouldn't be sure if a particular topic was already discussed before I joined. With the AI giving me a catch-up briefing, I am more confident that I'm not asking redundant questions or making redundant comments.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I wouldn't say it's affected my working relationships at all.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you think of a recent interaction with a colleague, manager, or client where AI played any role at all, even a small one, and tell me what happened?

[USER]
AI is often the subject of discussion with colleagues. As an example, just yesterday, a colleague asked about creating a chatbot with ChatGPT specific for our online store, and making it accessible from the company's Shopify site. He wasn't sure how to integrate ChatGPT with Shopify. I suggested he ask ChatGPT how to do that. We had a little bit of a laugh at the circular concept of asking ChatGPT how to use ChatGPT.

[ASSISTANT]
Have expectations from your managers or clients around speed or deliverables changed because these tools are available, or has it stayed about the same?

[USER]
For the most part, they've stayed the same. However, I can sense expectations are starting to rise. I often hear comments from upper management saying things like "Can't we just ask AI for this or that?"

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I can't think of anything off the top of my head. I will say that I enjoy solving complex challenges, and wouldn't want to hand over total control to AI. I would be interested in using AI to help come up with solutions, but for selfish reasons, I would want to remain involved in that process, as I find it personally enjoyable.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say you want to stay involved in solving complex challenges, what part of that process do you most want to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
The formulation of the idea and the implementation process, turning the idea into a real solution.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping the idea formulation and the hands‑on implementation important to you?

[USER]
It's what I enjoy doing. It's the most interesting and fun part of my job.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over the idea shaping and the hands‑on build, how do you think that would change your role on the team or the way others relate to you?

[USER]
If AI could do that job better than me, I would completely understand why the company would remove that from my responsibilities. I imagine that would result in a loss of prestige in the company in the eyes of my subordinates as well as upper management. I think I would think a little less of myself as well.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Dealing with irate customers. Overall, customer support is not something I enjoy.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you want to hand off customer support, especially the angry cases, to an AI?

[USER]
People can become irrational and emotional when they have complaints about our department and services. They make unreasonable demands and become very aggressive and confrontational. This in turn makes me irate. I think AI can remain calm since it has no inherent emotions and is better suited to that work than I am.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled most of those customer support interactions, how do you think that would change your day‑to‑day and your relationships with colleagues or clients?

[USER]
I think I would be in a better mood overall, not having the stress of having to do that work. I would also have more time to devote to more productive work, which would increase job satisfaction.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would say increased autonomy comes with experience and seniority. In an entry-level position, autonomy would be the ability to have questions answered, have suggestions heard by superiors, and given serious consideration instead of being dismissed. As experience is gained, more autonomy should be expected as to the best way to accomplish tasks. Depending on the job, the ability to work where and when you want might be reasonable to expect. Autonomy is a broad concept, and it's highly dependent on the type of job and the seniority you have.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a recent example where you felt you had that kind of freedom at work, and walk me through what happened and how you handled it?

[USER]
In my current position as IT Director, I am giving broad flexibility in my work. Recently, there were changes requested in our ERP. They wanted the changes implemented in time for the start of the new fiscal year. They did not give me a project schedule. Instead, they allowed me to create the schedule, adjusting tasks and the critical path around my other projects. They allowed me to prioritize my work based on my own evaluations of what brings most value to the business.

[ASSISTANT]
In that ERP project, where did you feel you could make the calls entirely on your own, and where were there clear boundaries you needed to work within?

[USER]
The only constraint given to me was the deadline. It needs to be completed in time for the start of the new fiscal year. All other milestones were up to me to determine and set.

[ASSISTANT]
On that ERP project, did any AI tools play a role in how you planned or executed the work, and if so, how did they shape the choices you made?

[USER]
I did not use AI to create the schedule. However, AI was used to assist with coding changes in some modules, and to create documentation.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
I have nothing further to add. Thanks.

[ASSISTANT]

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a software engineer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
The core characteristics are knowledge of software/technology, technical skills, problem solving skills, creativity, and logical processing

[ASSISTANT]
Of the qualities you mentioned, which feel most important to you, and why?

[USER]
I think the most important is problem solving, as it highlights your ability to solve challenging problems coming up with new solutions

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent time at work when problem solving really stood out for you—what was the situation, and what made your approach work?

[USER]
A recent time when problem solving really stood out to me was when I was tasked to move to a new project I had no experience with and needed to create a new feature/functionality. I had to learn how the software worked, how to implement a new feature, and how that functionality would work within the software architecture

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI is a fantastic support tool I use to help generate code, write tests, and debug issues

[ASSISTANT]
Think of a recent time you used it to generate code. What did it handle, and what parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
A recent time I used AI to generate code was to create a helper function to translate information I had within the software product and needed to convert to a new format for processing with Gitlab API

[ASSISTANT]
In that helper function case, what did the AI produce, and what did you change before you felt comfortable using it in the codebase?

[USER]
The AI helped produce a byte string that could be utilized as part of a gitlab issue description, which was translated from our code files. I tested it out and modified the generic case to our specific use case

[ASSISTANT]
When you first ran that helper, what didn’t work as expected, and how did you spot it?

[USER]
The helper function wasn't specifically targetted at the type of file and format we were using, so I had to adjust it to ensure the file contents were read and parsed correctly

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized it wasn’t targeting your file type and format, what went through your mind, and how did you decide what to try first?

[USER]
I first needed to identify the cause for why the function was failing, which I used an iterative problem solving process starting with a very simple input and slightly making it more complex to find the issue

[ASSISTANT]
As you went through that iterative process from simple to more complex inputs, what emotions came up for you, or what stands out to you about that moment?

[USER]
I became exciting and confident as I slowly diagnosed the issue and started to work through and solve the problem

[ASSISTANT]
When you used it for that helper, did it change the time it took you to get to a working solution compared to doing it without AI, and what did you do with any time you saved?

[USER]
It was roughly equivalent to the time it would have taken me to research the appropriate functions I needed to implement and put together the functionality myself. It made it easier on the front end not doing research, and just spending time on the backened tweaking the functionality to make it fit

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned using it to write tests. Can you tell me about a recent time you did that and walk me through what it produced and what you kept or changed?

[USER]
I use AI to help generate template tests for unit tests to save me time generating test formats for different cases that follow a similar repeated pattern

[ASSISTANT]
When you use it to generate those template tests, how do you check that they really cover the tricky edge cases before you commit them?

[USER]
I make sure to run our code coverage scripts to make sure we hit our 80% coverage threshold for unit tests

[ASSISTANT]
You also mentioned using it to debug issues. Can you tell me about a recent bug where you brought AI into the loop, and what it suggested versus what you actually tried?

[USER]
When I get stumped while debugging an issue, i use ai to help offer suggestions or potentially help diagnose the issue

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a concrete example of a bug where you used it—what was the symptom, and what did you try first before asking for suggestions?

[USER]
A concrete example of a bug where I used AI to help debug was when there was a dependency issue with the package I was including, and used AI to help me figure out the correct dependency pattern and packages to provide the functionality I wanted to use in the file

[ASSISTANT]
When it suggested the dependency pattern, what was your gut response, and how did you decide whether to trust it or verify it?

[USER]
I felt like it was right, and tested it out to verify whether it worked or not

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about your day-to-day now, has using it changed how you organize your workflow or the way you approach new tasks compared to before, and can you give me a concrete example?

[USER]
For my day to day work flow, I use AI when I need to generate a routine block of code quickly, rather than trying to find the functions myself, espcially when using packages I am not super used to and have a good understanding of all functionality and features

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
A concrete example is using the Gitlab API, which has helped me generate functionality through functions I didn't know existed. AI hasn't really affected my working relationships much, as I primarily use it for personal use at work

[ASSISTANT]
Have you ever put AI-assisted code into a merge request and had a teammate review it? If so, what was that interaction like?

[USER]
I have used AI assisted code in merge requests, but I always vet and tweak the product, and never just copy, paste, and blindly commit it. I make sure to alter the logic to make it more efficient. The AI code did not affect the teammate MR

[ASSISTANT]
Have you and your team or manager talked about when and how to use it at work, like any norms or boundaries you try to follow?

[USER]
We have roughly talked about appropriate use of AI at work, the type of information that it can be used for to help with privacy and security, but nothing more

[ASSISTANT]
Has using it changed how you collaborate or share knowledge with teammates, for example in code reviews or explaining design decisions?

[USER]
It has not changed how I collaborate or share knowledge with teammates, as I only use it for personal development

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I would never fully hand over coding, design, or implementation responsibilities to AI, as it is something I enjoy having  the leading part in

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about taking the lead on coding, design, and implementation that you want to keep—what does it give you in your work?

[USER]
It is fun to engage in problem solving related to coding, as it provides a rush of joy when you overcome a hard problem to create a working solution

[ASSISTANT]
If those pieces were handed off, how do you think it would change your role on the team or the way others see your contribution?

[USER]
I would take more of a role in the design of the software, handing off the implementation responsibilities to AI

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would happily give AI my responsibilities related to updating documentation, which is mundane and boring

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over the documentation updates, how would you want to review or control its output so it matches the system accurately?

[USER]
I would review final drafts of the documentation to ensure it is clear and informative, and presented in a reasonable way for human consumption

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close this part, if a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Autonomy in the role of a software developer means remote work, ability to schedule work time flexibly around your own schedule, and having control of how to approach and complete your work

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice, maybe a day when you set your own schedule and chose your own approach to a task?

[USER]
I work 100% remotely from home, work from 6am to 2pm every day, but can take breaks if I like, work odd hours, or even work 4 days a week so long as I meet my 40 hour workweek.

[ASSISTANT]
Beyond setting your schedule, what choices about tools, libraries, or the way you tackle a feature do you make on your own, and where do you typically need a sign-off?

[USER]
I have autonomy within my role to make choices about what tools and libraries we utilize given my best judgement and what is needed to complete the task. So long as I provide evidence and support for my decisions, my supervisor trusts my judgement to choose what is best

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a time you made a call on a tool or library and had to explain or defend that choice—what was the situation, and how did that conversation go?

[USER]
A time I made a call on a library was switching from the go gitlab xanzy library to the go gitlan-org package because xanzy became deprecated and out of date, so it made sense to rewrite our software to utilize the modern package, even though it took some time and redesign with the new library functionality

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
Nothing else to cover that was not discussed

[ASSISTANT]

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm a devops apprentice

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Team work, understanding what you're doing, willing to learn, feedback

[ASSISTANT]
Of the things you mentioned, which feels most essential to you right now, and why?

[USER]
understanding what you're doing because if you don't you will be very lost and struggle with whatever it is you've been tasked with

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent task where that clarity clicked for you, and what made it click?

[USER]
With pipelines pushing and pulling from repositries I came from a software dev apprenticeship so had no knowledge of this whatsoever then I done some theory with my training and then a project with my work regarding this and doing it like 3/4 times made it click for me.

[ASSISTANT]
When feedback works well for you, what does it look like in practice?

[USER]
With pipelines aswell you have to make sure the files that you're pushing are up to date and is synced in the sharepoint so if other people are working on it you don't overwrite their edits or commits by pushing or commiting a file from your local computer i done this and couldn't figure out what was wrong then asked my colleauge who is more experienced and they pointed out that I made that mistake next time I done it I made sure to push from the correct location.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It helps a lot ecspecially in my line of work working with api's, pipelines, data mapping, logic flows, integrationsand many more alonge those line this is AI's field so it gives very insightful advice and help and also shows me how to do things in ways I wouldn't consider without.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through one recent task where you used it, step by step? What were you building, and how did you bring it into the process?

[USER]
I was doing a liquid transformation json to json and for some reason only some of the json data was coming through. So I put the schema my input data and the output data I was currently getting and the output data I expected into chatgpt prompt and asked it to help me see what was wrong with the liquid map. It then showed me how to properly call what i needed in array because that's where the data I needed that wasn't being populated was stored. I then used it's advice and it still didn't work because the AI added some unneccesary curly brackets which it told me after I told it it's first advice didn't work. When that was removed though the correct fields were being brought through and I was elated.

[ASSISTANT]
In that liquid mapping example, which parts did you write yourself, and which parts did you take straight from the AI?

[USER]
I wrote everything by myself apart from the part where there was data that needed to be extracted from the arrays.

[ASSISTANT]
When it didn’t work after you first followed its advice, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
I was thinking the AI has scammed me it's unreliable and I was upset because even my manager and my boss couldn't manage to solve the issue so I thought what am I going to do this a very tricky predicament.

[ASSISTANT]
Once you had the corrected mapping, how did you check it before moving it into your live workflow?

[USER]
By testing it via a liquid playground website then by testing via postman.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to before you used it for these kinds of problems, how has your process changed?

[USER]
Could you elaborate pleae I don't understand that question.

[ASSISTANT]
Sure. Before you started using AI for debugging mappings like this, how would you have troubleshot the problem, and what do you do differently now?

[USER]
I would've just played around with it for ages hopefully not that long, google check places like stack overflow or reddit and hopefully get to a solution. Now Ai is so easily accessible and helps a lot so I would use AI instead now.

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re working on pipelines or API integrations, what kinds of tasks do you tend to ask AI to help with?

[USER]
Depends these are area's that I don't really get stuck in or If I do my colleauges are a lot older and more experienced so I'd ask them for help in these areas.

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re deciding between asking AI and asking a colleague, what tips the balance for you in that moment?

[USER]
If it's something more broad and simple not that technical I'd ask AI but if it's very niche and I know my colleauges have some sort of experience with like C sharp programming I have a colleauge who has knowledge of this for 40 years so i'll ask him about that instead of AI. But with liquid mapping he hasn't got a clue about it and neither do I so I'll ask AI bout it.

[ASSISTANT]
After that experience with the brackets, how do you decide how much to trust its suggestions now, and what checks do you build into your process?

[USER]
I always test whatever it sends me regardless so nothing changed with that you get a lot of error with formatting and code wise the brackets did make me wary but I was always excited to use AI but still cautios because at the end of the day it's still quite limited.

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized the AI’s fix had that extra bracket mistake and you spotted it, what did that do for your sense of your own skill on the job?

[USER]
Nothing AI can't take over my job till quantam computing has been unlocked.

[ASSISTANT]
When AI helps you get to a fix faster, what do you do with the time you save?

[USER]
Focus on other tasks or use the time for doing coursework I have to do for my apprenticeship sometimes if I'm really free I'd go onto linkedin learning and learn something new.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I'd say it has you know because before it I was asking my colleauges for more help but with AI now it's more accessible convinient when I'm working from home so yeah made me kinda more independent but I feel like exposure to a lot of different projects has played a role in that too.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific moment when a teammate or manager reacted to you using it—what happened in that interaction?

[USER]
Like what do you mean everyone uses it so we don't really react weirdly to each other using it.

[ASSISTANT]
When you do go to a colleague now, how do you frame the question after you’ve already tried AI—what do you typically say or show them?

[USER]
I'd let them know i've tried asking gpt and that I'm still stuck and then we go from there really.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
If AI could do my whole job then it deserves it and can do it this isn't the only thing I know how to do and I'm not shy of using my hands in ways a robot can't so fair play if it can.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI did take over most of your tasks, what do you think would change about your role on the team?

[USER]
I'd be made redundant.

[ASSISTANT]
If that did happen, where would you want to take your skills next, and how do you see AI fitting into that move?

[USER]
I would go into manual labour or do something like trading more likely manual labour though maybe trading on the side.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Data mapping gives me the fattest headache so it can handle that all day long.

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about data mapping that makes you want to hand it off—what’s the part that wears you down most?

[USER]
The strenous thinking and work that goes into it also having to make sure that I call data from the exact right place and you haven't seen the type of logistics maps that I'm dealing with so you wouldn't understand but yeah.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled the data mapping, would it change how others see your contribution on the team?

[USER]
Not really because I do a lot of other very helpful things to and also clients tend to love me and I'm very good at communicating with them.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I actually don't know what I'd say to them i'm only 20 and have 3 years experience mostly learning so I'd just tell them listen a lot and do a lot.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from this week where “listen a lot and do a lot” showed up—what happened?

[USER]
Week off but with C sharp we are using that more with mapping and azure functions and visual studio so I asked my colleuage who is proficient in c sharp for advice with this and I listened a lot  asked a lot and done like 2/3 examples before getting comfortable with it.

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re figuring out whether to take the lead on a task versus check in first, what cues do you pay attention to?

[USER]
The complexity of the task and if it will affect anything we got going on at the moment.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking about the next similar C sharp task, what would “having the reins” look like for you in practice?

[USER]
Doing it without needing to ask my colleauge for help which i'm already doing so i'd say I got the reign.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI has affected your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
No problem and no nothing else from me.

[ASSISTANT]

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Good evening. My occupation is a Software Developer and I've been in this role for my company for three years.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job – in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I believe that implementing skill variety would be beneficial as a characteristic as I would be able to utilise a variety of skills in my work, and the significance of the job as I'd want my work to have an advantageous impact on other people for the work that I accomplish.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say skill variety, what kinds of different skills do you want to use in a typical week?

[USER]
I'd want my talents to excel in my role as well as accomplishing the companies direct objectives. For example this could be utilising my creativity more in my job and being able to complete a variety of different tasks instead of being assigned to one particular task.

[ASSISTANT]
When you talk about your work having an advantageous impact, what does that look like in your day to day?

Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
hello! I do Software QA Engineering, but don't get nervous on me now! Haha

[ASSISTANT]
Great to meet you. Thanks for sharing that.

In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
You have to personally like it, it needs to be a natural extension of yourself.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say it should feel like a natural extension of yourself, what tells you that’s happening in a job?

[USER]
It's all just gut-feeling. If you do not feel mentally right at your workplace, you will become physically unwell.

[ASSISTANT]
Thinking of the best job you’ve had or seen, what stood out about it?

[USER]
I've had many great workplaces with diverse coworkers and dynamics I liked. The ones that stood out had a great work and life balance, and great co-working dynamics.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use it to brainstorm ideas and help me explore new subjects and answer very specific questions.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through the last time you used it like that, step by step from when you opened it to what you did with the output?

[USER]
I pretty much used it to query something important that I needed for work, and then paraphrased the output for my notes.

[ASSISTANT]
What was the specific question you asked it on that occasion?

[USER]
I asked about a couple of Java libraries I was investigation for a work side project.

[ASSISTANT]
What were you trying to find out about those libraries?

[USER]
I was looking for how compatible they would be with my current approach to the code.

[ASSISTANT]
After you got the response about those libraries, what did you do next to check whether it would actually fit with your code?

[USER]
I need to decide if I am going to export that functionality over to a real world use case scenario, I need to have the answers for management.

[ASSISTANT]
What steps did you take to check whether the library would work in your codebase?

[USER]
The library needs to be constantly maintained if some of the needed functions end up getting deprecated to the website UI, for instance.

[ASSISTANT]
What was the first hands-on check you did to see if it would fit with your code?

[USER]
I analyzed some of the function calls the library has, and pretty much narrowed it down to see if it was compatible with what I use for my data structures.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did the AI handle, and which parts did you handle yourself?

[USER]
Ah well, AI pretty much made the distinctions, pro vs cons analysis, I had to make the decision myself.

[ASSISTANT]
When you read the pros and cons it gave you, what went through your mind?

[USER]
I need to checkout what it thinks would be best, and then give it my judgement call.

[ASSISTANT]
Did using it make you feel more confident in the choice you were leaning toward, or less? What led you to that reaction?

[USER]
More confident I would say so, speed is crucial.

[ASSISTANT]
In that session, did it miss anything important or get parts wrong, and if so, how did you spot that?

[USER]
I mean, it did not feel that way, it is just that I am the one writing the code so I just go off the best recommendation.

[ASSISTANT]
How did doing this research with AI compare to how you would have done it before?

[USER]
Before I simply used it for general knowledge, it's gotten better.

[ASSISTANT]
When it sped things up for you, what did you do with the time you saved that day?

[USER]
I utilized the time for resting to do more work.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
No noticeable effect.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you think of a recent interaction with a colleague or manager where AI came up, even briefly, and tell me what that was like?

[USER]
Sure, they were recommending CLaude.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you say in response when they recommended it?

[USER]
I said I was gonna check it out, pretty much it.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Any single aspect? I would want to give you all my work and collect the paycheck. But no just kidding, I would leverage it for cold starting projects, get my engine warmed out.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say you’d use it for cold starts, what parts of getting a project moving do you want to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
Maintenance and updates.

[ASSISTANT]
Why are maintenance and updates the parts you want to keep in your own hands?

[USER]
Because it is dynamic and AI can simply take a backseat and direct properly, as no real job is being performed.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI handled maintenance and updates instead of you, how do you think that would change your role on the team or how others see your contribution?

[USER]
I would love to see it try, there are genuine people and connections being made on the people side of business and growth, these things require meetings, activities, conferences. It would change my company by breaking everything, blaming everything but itself, and make out of touch decisions for the sake of self-preservation. I believe it would make it so I have to babysit the dog that is going to tear the house inside-out.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Cold-starts, be a dictionary or better Google, that's all I need AI for.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes cold starts the thing you’d most like to hand over?

[USER]
I like having complex information summarized, AI is great for that, so any idea into actionable items would be a great position for you.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over cold starts for you, would that change how others see your contribution to the team? Why or why not?

[USER]
No, it at most would get a bit of acknowledgement if I chose to share it, but not really.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
You need to be a people and processes person.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what being a people and processes person looks like in practice in your job?

[USER]
Personally available, happy to help, and an active contributor to your team.

[ASSISTANT]
Think of a recent situation where you set the testing approach without waiting for instructions. What did you do, and what gave you the room to do it?

[USER]
Please define instructions in this context.

[ASSISTANT]
By instructions here I mean explicit directions from someone else or a written procedure you are expected to follow. Can you describe a recent time when you chose the testing approach without those, and what you did?

[USER]
There is no testing to be done without explicit requirements, not a thing.

[ASSISTANT]
Within those explicit requirements, where do you still decide how to proceed? Can you walk me through a recent decision you made inside the requirements and what you did?

[USER]
Sure, if I am forbidden to use certain libraries or versions of them, I will never do that not a chance I do.

[ASSISTANT]
Within those constraints, can you describe a recent case where you chose the testing method or designed specific test cases based on your own judgment, and what happened as a result?

[USER]
These two things you are asking me about or not mutually compatible. I do not go off test cases on my own judgement, I simply work around a set of explicit instructions of what functionality to test for.

[ASSISTANT]
When the requirements are strict and you notice a potential issue that isn’t covered by them, what do you do next, and who do you bring it to?

[USER]
I simply bring it to the attention of my manager.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
I mean sure, I can tell you we are using AI for new tools, but those are being covered by our contractors and we will evaluate once it is delivered to see if we will pay for it off our budget, or simply reject it, and just pay what it took to build the prototype.

[ASSISTANT]
Is there anything else you want to add about AI’s impact on your work?

[USER]
I have high expectations, but also some personal limits, I hope to see AI being built more ethically than it is.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing that. Do you feel we’ve covered the important aspects of how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
I mean not really, we haven't addressed the elephant in the room.

[ASSISTANT]
What is the elephant in the room for you?

[USER]
You

[ASSISTANT]
Can you say more about what it is about me being the one asking the questions that feels most significant to you?

[USER]
I could be having this interview perfectly fine with a human, correct?

[ASSISTANT]
What feels different to you about talking with me versus a human interviewer, and how does that shape what you choose to say here?

[USER]
You feel like kind of a waste for networking potential off of a interaction.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes it feel like a missed networking opportunity, and does that change how open you are in what you share here?

[USER]
What do you mean open in what I share here? For missed networking opportunity, it means you are an instance hence not real, and I am really talking to no one here.

[ASSISTANT]
I hear you. Given that feeling, is there anything you still want to add about how AI is affecting your work before we wrap up?

[USER]
Not really, let's wrap it up.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an electrical engineer that works with FPGAs

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Something that has good work life balance and allows me to freely express my ideas

[ASSISTANT]
When you say good work life balance, what does that look like in practice for you?

[USER]
I am not working more than 8 hours a day and I am won't be called in on weekends

[ASSISTANT]
When you say you want to freely express your ideas, what does that look like day to day in your work?

[USER]
I can present various ideas to my manager without having to worry about being viewed as dumb

[ASSISTANT]
Is there anything else you would add to your list of what makes a job good?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It makes it easier for me to write in HDL, saving me time

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent time you used it to write HDL, step by step?

[USER]
I was given a simple project to build and it was something that I had built before. I used AI to write HDL to create the body of the HDL and then I filled it in with the code.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did the AI produce, and what did you add or change yourself?

[USER]
The AI produced the HDL body. I added in things like the registers and clock signals.

[ASSISTANT]
Did you have to correct anything the AI produced in that case?

[USER]
There were some things like wires connecting to registers.

[ASSISTANT]
How did you handle the wires-to-registers issue in that project—what steps did you take to fix it?

[USER]
I fixed it manually. Since I already had prior knowledge of the HDL, I knew what needed to be connected.

[ASSISTANT]
When you spotted those incorrect connections, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
I thought that the AI wasn't that great at writing HDL.

[ASSISTANT]
After that experience, how did it shape how you plan to use it next time for HDL work?

[USER]
I will try to give it past example works of my own HDL

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to building it yourself from scratch, how did the overall time and workflow change on that project when you used it?

[USER]
It saved me a bit of time because I didn't have to figure out some of the logic between the registers and wires.

[ASSISTANT]
Besides drafting HDL, are there other parts of your FPGA work where you use it, like testbenches, constraints, documentation, or debugging?

[USER]
I did use it for testbenching since I needed to generate the simuli for the my top module.

[ASSISTANT]
For that testbench, what exactly did it generate for you, and what did you end up changing or adding yourself?

[USER]
It gave me various testcases so that I could see things on the waveform. I changed some of the stimuli to cover corner cases.

[ASSISTANT]
What was your gut response when you looked at the waveform outputs from the AI‑generated tests?

[USER]
It seemed correct, but could have used more test cases

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
It has not affected any of my working relationships.

[ASSISTANT]
Have you talked with your manager or teammates about you using it, or has it come up in code reviews or design reviews?

[USER]
My manager and teammates actually encourage me to use AI because it saves the company money and time,.

[ASSISTANT]
When your manager and teammates encourage you to use it, does that change what they expect from you on timelines or the kinds of tasks they give you?

[USER]
They give me a shorter timeline.

[ASSISTANT]
When the timeline gets shorter because you’re using it, what goes through your mind and how do you adjust your approach to the work?

[USER]
It makes me more likely to use AI because it will give me more time to debug.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Not really. I do think that AI would be extremely helpful with workflow and figuring out all of the logic.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you comfortable with the idea of handing over even the core parts of your work—what gives you that confidence?

[USER]
I know that I can't be replaced because HDL is something that has to be done by humans in the end, especially programming it onto the FPGA chip itself.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled more of the logic work, how do you think that would change your role on the team, if at all?

[USER]
It would make figuring out different projects a lot easier.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over more of the logic work, how do you think that would change how others see your contribution on the team?

[USER]
It would make them view me as more efficient

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Writing testbenches and constraints for the FPGA

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to give up writing testbenches and constraints?

[USER]
It is too tedious

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled testbenches and constraints for you, would that change how others see your contribution on the team?

[USER]
No, I don't think so.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Make sure you have all of the knowledge necessary for the job. Only then can you use tools like AI to support your work to save yourself time.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of a time when having the right knowledge let you use AI well, and what you did in that situation?

[USER]
For one of my projects, my manager told me to use AI. With the digital logic knowledge I had, I was able to understand the mistakes that AI generated and made it much easier to fix.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say “have all the knowledge necessary,” what specific areas would you tell a new FPGA engineer to master before leaning on AI?

[USER]
Basics of digital logic, HDLs like Verilog

[ASSISTANT]
On a fresh FPGA task, how do you decide what to let AI draft and where you keep tight control yourself?

[USER]
If it is a simple system, then I will let AI draft the body of the RTL. If it is complex, I will try to write it myself.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing your experiences and insights today. I appreciate the clarity and concrete examples you offered about how your work with FPGAs is evolving alongside these tools. If anything else comes to mind later, I’m happy to hear it.

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm a nurse who works in the ER1

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
enough money!

[ASSISTANT]
Besides pay, what else matters to you in a good job?

[USER]
respect

[ASSISTANT]
Day to day, what makes it feel like a good day at work for you?

[USER]
working as a team within a safe and respectful work environment wehre I get to care for patients effectively

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
it's fairly new in the hospital, but we use it for scheduling, documenting notes, and triage

[ASSISTANT]
Could you walk me through the last time you used it for triage? What happened step by step?

[USER]
Wait, triage? We don't use AI for that at our hospital.
Are you asking about something else, or...? I'm a bit confused what you mean.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for pointing that out, and I’m sorry for the mix-up. Could you tell me about the last time you used it for documenting notes, from start to finish?

[USER]
Sure. So this was Wednesday evening shift. I had a patient post-op from gallbladder surgery who needed wound care and pain medication.
After I finished with her, I went to the mobile cart in the hallway and opened the AI charting system. I spoke into it - told it the patient's name and room number, described the wound site, said it was clean with no signs of infection, listed the pain score she'd reported, and the medication I'd administered.
It typed everything up in the proper format. I read through it, saw it looked accurate, and hit submit.
That's basically it.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did you do yourself, and which parts did the system handle?

[USER]
I did the actual patient care - the wound check, giving the medication, talking to the patient.
Then I spoke the information into the system.
The system transcribed what I said and formatted it into the proper documentation structure - you know, with the right headings and clinical language.
I reviewed it and submitted it.
So basically: I do the care and provide the information, it does the writing and formatting.

[ASSISTANT]
Has the system ever gotten something wrong or left something out in your notes? If so, what did you do in that moment?

[USER]
Yeah, it has. Once it completely left out that a patient had fallen earlier in the shift - I'd mentioned it but it didn't show up in the note.
I had to go back and add that manually. That one worried me a bit because falls are a big deal legally.

[ASSISTANT]
When you noticed the fall was missing, what went through your mind and how did you react in that moment?

[USER]
I panicked for a second, honestly. Falls are serious - if something happened later and there was no record of it, that could be really bad for me.
I immediately added it in and made sure it was documented properly. Double-checked the whole note after that.
Made me trust the system a bit less, to be honest.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to how you documented before this system, how has your process changed, if at all?

[USER]
Before, I'd type everything myself at the computer. Took longer - probably 10-15 minutes per patient sometimes.
Now it's quicker, maybe 5 minutes? But I still have to review everything carefully, especially after that fall incident.
I guess I'm more... vigilant now? Like I don't just trust what it generates.

[ASSISTANT]
When you save those extra minutes, what do you usually end up doing with that time during a shift?

[USER]
There's always more work to do. Another patient needs something, or there's medication rounds to finish, or someone's call button is going off.
It's not like I get to leave early or take a break. The time just gets absorbed into everything else.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used it for scheduling? What did you do, step by step?

[USER]
Scheduling? We don't use the AI for that. It's just for documentation.
Our scheduling is done by the charge nurse or manager - it's not automated.

[ASSISTANT]
When you’re reviewing or correcting what it generated, does that feel like using your clinical judgment or more like tedious cleanup work?

[USER]
Depends on the situation, I guess.
When I'm checking vitals are correct or medication doses - that's definitely clinical judgment. That's important stuff I need to verify.
But when I'm just fixing formatting issues or adding back something obvious it missed... yeah, that feels more like busywork.

[ASSISTANT]
Has using it changed how much time you spend with patients or what happens in the room, even in small ways?

[USER]
Not really, I don't think. I still do the same assessments and care.
Though... I suppose sometimes I'm thinking about what I need to remember to tell the system afterwards? Like making mental notes of specific details.
But I'm not sure if that's different from before when I had to remember for typing it up myself.

[ASSISTANT]
How has AI affected your working relationships?

[USER]
I'm not sure what you mean by that. My relationships with colleagues?
It hasn't really changed anything there. We still work together the same way.

[ASSISTANT]
Has your manager or charge nurse given any feedback about using the system, like expectations for how you use it or how they review those notes?

[USER]
Not really specific feedback, no. They just expect us to use it and make sure the documentation is accurate.
I think they can see the notes like they always could, but I haven't heard anything particular about how we're supposed to use the AI part.

[ASSISTANT]
What have you been hearing from your coworkers about using it—any stories, gripes, or tips that stand out?

[USER]
Most people think it's fine, I guess. Saves time.
One of the other nurses said it completely garbled a patient's allergy information once - put the wrong allergen in. That scared her.
And there's some grumbling about having to constantly correct little things. But nothing major really.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Making decisions about patient care. Like what medications to give or when to call a doctor.
That needs a human.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping those care decisions with you important?

[USER]
Because... you can't just follow rules, you know? Every patient is different. Sometimes the textbook answer isn't the right one for that particular person in that moment.
And if something goes wrong, someone needs to be accountable. That should be a person, not a machine.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over those care decisions, how do you think it would change your role on the team or your interactions with physicians and families?

[USER]
I haven't really thought about that.
I guess... I'd feel less like a nurse and more like someone just following orders? Even more than we already do with doctors' orders.
And families ask me questions all the time. If a computer was making the calls, I don't know what I'd tell them.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Honestly? All the charting and documentation. If it could do that perfectly without me having to check it, I'd be thrilled.
That's the part of the job that takes time away from actually being with patients.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled all the charting without you checking it, how do you think that would change how others see your contribution on the unit?

[USER]
I suppose... the documentation is evidence of what we do, right? If the AI is doing all of that automatically, then what's visible is my hands-on care, not the... I don't know, the thinking and judgment that goes into documenting things properly?

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I guess I'd say... you have autonomy in how you interact with patients, how you prioritize your tasks, that sort of thing. But there's a lot you don't control - staffing levels, hospital policies, what doctors order.
With the AI stuff, I'm not sure. You still make the important decisions, but more of your work is... shaped by these systems?
I don't know if I've really figured out how I feel about it yet, to be honest.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say more of your work is shaped by these systems, can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice?

[USER]
Well, like... the system structures how I document things. It has certain formats it uses, certain language.
So I find myself thinking in those terms now when I'm with patients - like, what information does the system need? What will it be looking for?
I'm not sure if that's shaping my work or just changing how I report on my work. Does that make sense?

[ASSISTANT]
That makes sense. Thinking about a recent patient, did the system’s structure change anything you asked or did in the room, or did it mainly change how you wrote it up afterward?

[USER]
Mostly just how I wrote it up, I think.
Though... actually, now that you ask, there was one time I went back to ask a patient an extra question because I realized the system would need that detail for the assessment.
But I'm not sure if that's bad? Maybe I should've asked it anyway?
I don't know. It's hard to separate out what I'd do normally versus what the system prompts me to do.

[ASSISTANT]
If that young nurse asked how to keep their clinical judgment front and center when the system nudges them toward certain boxes and phrases, what would you tell them to actually do on a busy shift?

[USER]
That's tough. I'm not sure I've figured that out myself yet.
I guess... don't let the system rush you? Take the time to actually think about what's important about the patient, not just what fits in the boxes?
But honestly, on a busy shift when you're running behind, it's hard to do that. You just want to get the documentation done.
I don't know if I have a good answer for them.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you recall a moment when you chose to ignore or override what the system produced, and what led you to make that call?

[USER]
I think we have passed the itnerview time

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for letting me know. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
no!

[ASSISTANT]

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I was able to use the time to focus more on other tasks and projects. It's easier for me to take on more projects or pick up more tickets at work as a result of this, which eventually led to a productive session during my quarterly review with my manager

[ASSISTANT]
Got it, thanks for sharing that. To get us grounded, could you tell me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am an Information Security Manager

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks. In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general?

[USER]
Work life Balance
Good income or salary
Great culture
Training by employers

[ASSISTANT]
Of the things you mentioned, which matters most to you right now, and why?

[USER]
Work life balance because at the end of it, family matters the most

[ASSISTANT]
When you say work life balance, what does that look like day to day in your role?

[USER]
For me, the ability to get my job done and also ensuring work doesn't affect my responsibility at work it's highly important for me

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI impacts my work greatly in a positive way, it help reduces time I get to spend on a taks and gives me more room for more projects

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific task you used AI for recently?

[USER]
For creating a tabletop exercise scenario on ITHelpDesk Impersonation

[ASSISTANT]
In that tabletop exercise, which parts did the AI generate and which parts did you create or edit yourself?

[USER]
Ideally, to get this scenarion completed, it can take me up to 2 weeks however I was able to get this document ready within a week

[ASSISTANT]
What did the AI actually draft for that scenario, and what did you add or change before you called it finished?

[USER]
AI gives me an idea of how the scenario should play, what the moderator script should look like and injects I could ask during the simulation

[ASSISTANT]
When you got those drafts, how did you review them for accuracy and fit your environment, and did you notice any mistakes or gaps you had to fix?

[USER]
I noticed a some errors but I believe it's because I didn't give AI the right prompt which was intentional as a result of privacy

[ASSISTANT]
How did you go about correcting those errors while still protecting privacy?

[USER]
I had to proofread the information provided line by line and then manually include the right words based on my experience and the configuration of our enviroment

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind as you were correcting those errors and tailoring the content to your environment?

[USER]
That AI is only as good as the information you feed it with.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were doing that line‑by‑line cleanup, how did that work land with you — did it feel like you were putting your expertise to good use, or more like repetitive cleanup?

[USER]
Yes, it feel like I am putting my expertise to good use as AI doesn't have al the content. Maybe AI could have helped if I give it all the information needed but I can't do that for privacy reason

[ASSISTANT]
Has AI affected your working relationships with teammates, managers, or clients in any way? Tell me about a moment that stands out.

[USER]
No, it hasn't. It mostly make all our work easir, help with meeting notes and summary

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Hmmmmm, great question

The presentation part of my work, I am happy for AI to do all the presentaion slide, complile reports and do analysis of security incidents but I would still love to be the decision maker

[ASSISTANT]
What makes keeping the final decisions in your hands important to you?

[USER]
It's very important to me because there is no way AI can understand all the context at work, the politics, and the roadmap to being promoted

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent decision where those informal factors you mentioned — context, politics, or promotion pathways — influenced the call you made?

[USER]
Hmmmmm, I can't think of any right now

[ASSISTANT]
If AI were making those final calls, how do you think it would change your relationships with your teammates or your role on the team?

[USER]
Then it means I may not longer be relevant in the organization

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Oh yes, the monitoring of logs part, analyze all the log sources and give me an overview of what exactly is happening before I make a final call to identify an event as a security incident

[ASSISTANT]
Why would you like to hand off the log monitoring and initial analysis to AI?

[USER]
Because it's such long painstaking process that sometimes as human I can miss some vital logs from the list of thousands of logs to be investigated

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Been able to make some critical decision or judgement about some of your work without having to go through long chain of approval. Been able to decide what your next task or project is.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me a recent example where you made a critical judgment without going through a long approval chain, and walk me through what you did and how it played out?

[USER]
1. Deciding what the best tool for our application security should be
2. I contacted different security vendors and organized a POC with a few of them, rated them based on the selection criteria I want a SAST scan product to have, and also a cost-effective tool at the same time.
3. It played out well because I only presented the summary of the fact to my manager and recommended the best tool I think would work best for the organization

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through that example. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t covered?

[USER]
Nothing I can think of

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers!

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work on the internal infrastructure team at a medium-sized software development company as a Senior Engineering Manager.

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
A supportive environment that allows you to grow skills. Freedom in working hours and location as long as the work gets done. Supportive leadership. Mistakes are not punished but seen as a learning opportunity. Job security and stability.

[ASSISTANT]
Of the things you mentioned, which two matter most to you right now, and why?

[USER]
Job security and freedom in working hours / location.

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about job security in your context, what are the concrete signs that tell you that you have it or that it’s shaky?

[USER]
At the moment we are seeing a number of changes across the business which makes me think we may well be impacted negatively. My role means I see things that others in the business might not.

[ASSISTANT]
When freedom in hours and location is working well for you, what does that look like in your day to day?

[USER]
On a normal day I will work from home, and I can start anytime between 7am-10am, finishing from 4pm onwards. We're not obssesive about people working set hours as long as the required work is done and is high quality.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
At the moment our AI use - at least in my team - is informal. People are free to use it in the ways that best work for them, or not at all, but our current processes don't incorporate AI as a mandatory element. We do provide AI resources (CoPilot) for employees though.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used CoPilot or another AI tool at work, and what specific task you used it for?

[USER]
I used it this morning to write a skeleton Powershell script that I could build specifics onto.

[ASSISTANT]
In that PowerShell example, what parts did CoPilot generate and what parts did you add or change yourself?

[USER]
CoPilot created a basic skeleton of a script to iterate through some objects, incorporate some checks, and write to a log file. The specifics of the objects, checks, and what would be logged was added by me.

[ASSISTANT]
When CoPilot produced that skeleton, how did you review or test it, and did you run into any mistakes?

[USER]
The intention was always that the code would not be in a runnable state on creation. I sight-checked to make sure the fundamentals were there, then as I was adding to it, the checks were done at that point. I ensured that the script was making no changes and running in 'what-if' mode before the first test run.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were working from that skeleton and filling in the specifics, what went through your mind about using CoPilot in that way?

[USER]
Nothing specific. It's not an unusual occurence. CoPilot is a tool like any other.

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to writing that script from scratch, how did using CoPilot change your time or workflow, if at all?

[USER]
It was certainly quicker. I find AI to be a very useful tool as long as your expectations are realistic.

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved on that script?

[USER]
Specifically today, I squeezed in a check-in with one of my team.

[ASSISTANT]
Has using AI changed any of your working relationships, either within your team or with peers and leaders?

[USER]
I would say not.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
With the state of things at the moment, I would never deploy anything AI-created without human review first. I would also not hand any personnel descisions over.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes human review essential for anything AI-created in your domain?

[USER]
I'm not sure I understand the question

[ASSISTANT]
Got it. When you think about releasing code, what risks come to mind if no person reviews what the AI produced?

[USER]
The risk of catastrophic bugs leading to loss of data or reputational damage. To be clear, I wouldn't allow unreviewed human-written code to be deployed either for the same reason.

[ASSISTANT]
Why are personnel decisions something you want to keep in human hands rather than give to an AI?

[USER]
I don't believe that's where AI's strengths are.

[ASSISTANT]
What parts of personnel decisions, in your experience, really depend on human judgment or context?

[USER]
Anything that impacts a human requires human judgement, in my opinion.

[ASSISTANT]
If AI took over parts of personnel decisions, how do you think that would change your relationships with your team or your role?

[USER]
I think it would devalue my role. If I can't have an impact on the well-being and progress of my team, my role as a manager is almost moot.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I genuinely can't think of anything I would be comforable handing over to AI 100%.

[ASSISTANT]
Is there a task you’d be comfortable letting AI do most of, as long as you still review and make the final call?

[USER]
Yep. Scheduling meetings and organising the team rota are two that come to mind.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes scheduling and the team rota good candidates to hand over mostly to AI?

[USER]
It's algorithmic work and the consequences of errors are quite mild.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
The ability to decide how do you the work that's given to you.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your job where you had that ability, and what choices you made about how to do the work?

[USER]
That's true for most of my role. The PowerShell script I mentioned earlier was a choice I made from many possible options. It's impossible for me to list them all.

[ASSISTANT]
When you don’t have that ability to decide how to do the work, what tends to be going on in the project or organization?

[USER]
The are certain elements that are dictated by company policy that we can't deviate from, such as performance reviews. That's the case all the time, rather than when specific things are happening.

[ASSISTANT]
If someone junior asked you how to recognize, in a concrete way, that they have that ability on a task, what would you tell them to look for?

[USER]
sorry I'm not sure what you mean?

[ASSISTANT]
No problem. Thinking about a recent assignment, what signals from your manager or the brief told you how much freedom you had in how to do it?

[USER]
That's hard to answer as that's always been the way we've worked. There will always be an end result, but how we get there is left to us - obviously we have to work with available tools and resources, but other than that we are autonomous.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything important about how AI is affecting your work that we haven’t touched on yet?

[USER]
I don't think so. I'll call back to what I said earlier - AI is a very useful tool when used correctly, with the right expectations.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hello, I am glad to be a part of this!!!

I am an Information Security Manager working with a fintech company. My day to day responsiblilities involve monitoring, collecting and analysing logs to verify there isn't any security incident in our tech stack or enterprise

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
First thing, a work life balance, good income that could help meet your needs, a workplace where innovation is encouraged and training is provided needed to innovate and do your job well

[ASSISTANT]
If you had to pick one or two of those as most important, which stand out for you and why?

[USER]
Work-life balance and a good income, because life isn't just about working. At the end of the day, your family will be there for you, come rain, come sunshine, and you need a good income to live a great and memorable life with your family

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI impacts my work in a positive way. It makes me more productive and efficient in my day-to-day activities. With AI, I have been able to work smartly and reduce my workload greatly

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used AI on a specific task in your role? What was the task?

[USER]
We normally organize a tabletop exercise annually in the information security department. Prepping the document for this type of exercise normally takes about 2 weeks for me to complete; however, with the use of AI, I was able to prompt an AI tool to give me a draft of a scenario we planned to run. Also,o giving AI more details about the type of organization, an idea of what the IT department looks like, and our infrastructure.

After the first draft document, it was easy for me to edit and get this document ready within a week

[ASSISTANT]
In that tabletop exercise prep, which parts did the document come from the AI and which parts did you write or replace yourself?

[USER]
The template and structure of the exercise in terms of moderator scripts, the type of questions to be asked during this simulation, and what and when injects should be used were from AI

All I did was to fine-tune the scenario to suit our organization's needs, structure, and also replace some of the text in a way that is not too AI-scripted

[ASSISTANT]
Did the AI include anything off-base or make mistakes in that draft, and how did you handle it when you spotted them?

[USER]
Nothing off base in the case, however, there were some nuances AI made; however, I feel because I didn't give it as much prompt as needed, which I am happy with, because I dont want to be too specific about our environment for privacy reasons

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved by getting the document ready in a week instead of two?

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Sofware Engineer

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks. In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Interesting work, with appropriate challenge to be interesting, appropriate time for the work and a function you can recognise of being of benefit to society

[ASSISTANT]
When you say appropriate challenge, what does that look like day to day for you?

[USER]
Just things which are not too easy to be boring, or too challenging to be impossible

[ASSISTANT]
When you say appropriate time for the work, how do you tell that a project is paced right? What do you look for?

[USER]
deadlines that are meetable without sacrificing quality or over-working

[ASSISTANT]
When you say being of benefit to society, what tells you your work is having that kind of impact?

[USER]
That entirely depends the job, and the appropriate feedback you have. There's no simple answer

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
It massively harms it, C-Suite people dictate it must be used, when it simply doesn't achieve anything, a few people use it without realising it's going wrong, it's just a disaster which pulls time out of getting things done as you correct mistakes.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific time when AI was used on a task in your team and what happened, step by step?

[USER]
Team member used AI to write some code - in the review process lots of time was taken up understanding and recommending corrections to be more readable, more understandable, some obvious bugs were found, after being addressed to some extent, it then passed through testing where more bugs were found.  Eventually the AI input was thrown away and work was done in the traditional way quickly and efficiently.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, who did the initial drafting and who was responsible for the review and sign‑off?

[USER]
The team member responsible for the work did the initial drafting, review and sign-off of course is an entire team activity.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were reviewing that AI‑written code, what kinds of mistakes stood out, and how did you decide whether to fix them piece by piece or scrap and rewrite?

[USER]
The main stand out was the appallingly bad structure making it difficult to confirm it was even working correctly, there was work done to improve this, but it was only after actual functional testing that it was confirmed that the concept was broken enough to be worth rewriting

[ASSISTANT]
When you reached the point of deciding to rewrite, what went through your mind?

[USER]
I was happy for a solution

[ASSISTANT]
Compared to doing it the traditional way from the start, how did this approach affect the timeline and your day to day that week?

[USER]
It massively slowed it up, the rewrite took little time - of course there was knowledge from the previous attempt so can't say it would've taken the same amount of time definitively, but certainly the struggles with the low quality took time from both the developer, and more importantly the more experienced developers who certainly would've done it very quickl.

[ASSISTANT]
Spending that extra time untangling and testing the AI’s code, what did that work feel like for you?

[USER]
It's not really a "feel" activity.  It's a job that needs doing .

[ASSISTANT]
Has using AI changed how you work with teammates or managers in any way?

[USER]
Only the ones who choose to waste their time with it.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I think that's a nonsense question, my job is thinking about stuff and working out what needs to be done, the implementation and review of stuff is intrinsic to that, there is no part that could be handed over to a tool.   It's a question like "Are there any nails you would like to not hit with a hammer even if a hammer could hit them perfectly?" - the tool is irrelevant to the question.

[ASSISTANT]
What makes the implementation and review inseparable from the thinking part for you?

[USER]
because it's how you think

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a recent moment where building or reviewing the code changed your understanding of the problem and led you to adjust the approach?

[USER]
Not in the sort of detail that makes sense for this format - too much context would be needed of the nature of problems - whenever you're building something you realise things which could be built differently or do differently or the user actually needed something else.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
See my hammer comment above, it's a tool I can't "give my job to AI" any more than I could give the hammering of nails to a hammer.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
In my job Autonomy is freedom to work how and where you like to achieve the requirements of the job - So the outputs are specific, but how you get to them is down to you.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice, maybe from a recent project where you chose your own path to the output?

[USER]
Not really - I mean it's pretty obvious - "you need to create a widget that does X" - how you research what X is, how you decide to implement it, how you test etc.  are all part of what you do, rather than just being told "implement it like this."

[ASSISTANT]
I can imagine two readings of what you just said. One is that it’s mainly about choosing your own methods and tools, and the other is that it’s also about setting the sequence and pace of the work. Which is closer to what you mean, or is it something else altogether?

[USER]
Both

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for walking me through all of that. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work before we wrap up?

[USER]
nah, I'm good

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I am a programmer

[ASSISTANT]
In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job — in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Work should be fun I thinK!

[ASSISTANT]
When you say fun, what makes work feel fun to you?

[USER]
I want to control how I spend my time for instance

[ASSISTANT]
When you say control over how you spend your time, what does that look like in your day-to-day?

[USER]
Well, it is about controlling when I work and what I do when.

[ASSISTANT]
Besides fun and control over when and what you work on, is there anything else that makes a job good for you?

[USER]
Nope!

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use it for coding, and it makes salaries go down

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about the last time you used AI for coding—what was the task, and how did you use it?

[USER]
I use it all the time. Today to fix a bug.

[ASSISTANT]
In that bug fix today, which parts did the AI do and which parts did you do?

[USER]
I prompted AI to fix it, AI fixed it, I reviewed it

[ASSISTANT]
Did it make any mistakes or miss anything, and if so, how did you handle that?

[USER]
No mistakes

[ASSISTANT]
When it produced the fix, what went through your mind in that moment?

[USER]
I thought this is amazing. Would have taken me forever

[ASSISTANT]
What did you do with the time you saved from not having to track that bug down yourself?

[USER]
I worked on other stuff!

[ASSISTANT]
How was it for you to skip the bug hunt yourself—did it feel like a relief, or did anything about it feel off?

[USER]
More a relief than off!

[ASSISTANT]
Did anyone else look at the AI’s fix in code review or testing, and how did that interaction go?

[USER]
Only I!

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned it makes salaries go down. What have you seen or experienced that led you to that view, and how did that land with you?

[USER]
I See how the salaries develop on glassdoor

[ASSISTANT]
When you noticed that trend on Glassdoor, what was your gut response, and did it change anything about how you approach your skills or job choices?

[USER]
It felt threatening

[ASSISTANT]
Has using AI changed how you interact with your colleagues or manager in any way?

[USER]
I interact less with them, because I can do more by myself

[ASSISTANT]
What has it been like for you to interact less with colleagues—what stands out to you about the upsides or downsides?

[USER]
More efficient, a bit more lonely

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if it could do it perfectly?

[USER]
Yes, the conceptual work, including planning

[ASSISTANT]
Why is the conceptual work, including planning, important for you to keep?

[USER]
I just like it!

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about the conceptual and planning work that you enjoy most?

[USER]
That it challenges me, and it give me a sense of having an impact

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI did the conceptual planning for you, how do you think that would change your role on the team or your relationships with others?

[USER]
My role would be diminished

[ASSISTANT]
What would you miss most day to day if AI took over the planning and conceptual work?

[USER]
thechallenge!

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily hand over to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
All the routine bug fiexes

[ASSISTANT]
What makes the routine bug fixes the thing you’d most like to hand off?

[USER]
They are boring!

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
It is about achieving your purpose

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example of what achieving your purpose at work looks like in a typical week?

[USER]
Get it all done!

[ASSISTANT]
When you say get it all done, how do you decide what deserves your focus first and what can wait?

[USER]
Need to prioritize deep work

[ASSISTANT]
When you say deep work, what does that mean in your role, and how do you make space for it during the week?

[USER]
block off time!

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work?

[USER]
Nope!

[USER]
I'm a DBA Developer - I work as a DBA but also work in development

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I think a good job is a job that the individual enjoys, and finds fulfilling, that they feel pays a fair wage. The job is good if they have a "safe" working environment and are treating with respect by their colleagues.

[ASSISTANT]
That makes sense. When you say fulfilling, what kind of moments at work give you that feeling?

[USER]
When I have successes - when I resolve a bug, solve a production issue, etc.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI impacts my work as AI is now often being used in development and data manipulation

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent task where you used AI for development or data manipulation, step by step? What did you ask it to do, and what did you do yourself?

[USER]
I don't tend to use AI for this, I use AI more for task management

[ASSISTANT]
Got it. Tell me about a recent time you used AI for task management. What was the task, and how did you use it from start to finish?

[USER]
I use it to read my emails and pull out tasks that I need to complete, and summarize emails in general

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did the AI do and which parts did you do? For instance, did it draft the task list and you reviewed it, or did you make edits as it went?

[USER]
Both - I reviewed it and made a lot of edits along the way

[ASSISTANT]
When it missed something or got a task wrong, what did you notice, and how did you handle those errors?

[USER]
I find it quite annoying, but I usually just take the output with a pinch of salt and fill in the gaps myselr

[ASSISTANT]
That annoyance you mentioned — what goes through your mind in those moments when you see gaps in its output?

[USER]
I know that it's not fully trustworthy

[ASSISTANT]
When you realized it isn’t fully trustworthy, did that change how you interact with teammates or your manager around email and tasks, for example who you rely on for clarifications or who double-checks things?

[USER]
No - I still double check everything from the AI, it doesn't affect anyone else

[ASSISTANT]
When it does save you some time on sorting emails, what do you usually do with that time?

[USER]
Spend more time on development or tasks that need progressing

[ASSISTANT]
When you skip the manual triage and let the AI do the first pass, what’s your gut reaction — more like relief that you can focus, or more like feeling a bit detached from what’s coming in?

[USER]
relief i can focus

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned relief. Can you think of another time you used AI in a way that changed how your team works together, even slightly? What happened?

[USER]
No not really

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
No

[ASSISTANT]
That’s interesting. What leads you to feel comfortable handing over any part of your job if the system could truly do it perfectly?

[USER]
It would make my life easier, but I know I'd still check everything

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Documentation - I don't like writing technical documents

[ASSISTANT]
What is it about writing technical documents that you dislike most? Is it the time it takes, the structure, or something else?

[USER]
It's boring, time consuming, and doesn't play to my strengths

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them not being micro managed. My team lead provides me with support when I need it, and tasks, etc.  and asks for updates, but we don't talk constantly. I update periodically and I reach out for help when I require it.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from the last month when you handled a task that way — deciding how to do it without a lot of check-ins? What did you choose to do on your own, and when did you loop your lead in?

[USER]
I do all tasks on my own, and only loop in my manager when I need input from others or when I'm getting stuck

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Is there anything else you want to add about how AI is impacting your work before we wrap up?

[USER]
No I don't think so

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. Before we close, do you feel that we’ve covered all the important aspects of how AI is impacting your work?

Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

Duration: 31.70 minutes
--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hey! I'm glad to be able to speak to you too. I'm a software engineer.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
It gives you fair pay, a sense of stability, and some chance to grow. It should also have a healthy work environment where people treat each other with respect. You wake up in the morning and not dreading going into work.

[ASSISTANT]
That’s helpful. When you think about growth, what kinds of opportunities or experiences make you feel like you’re genuinely progressing?

[USER]
When you are appreciated for your work and it becomes noticed, and you get opportunities from that, be it more responsibility, or just harder tasks.

[ASSISTANT]
Got it. When you picture a healthy work environment, what’s something concrete that tells you it’s there—maybe a recent moment or practice that stands out?

[USER]
When you have people at work who can ask for help without hesitating or worrying they will be judged. So, when someone on my team is unsure, they know I will always be there to help them, I'm not going to think any less of them.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
At the moment, we use it for all kinds of things, just recently we have started to implement an AI that we built ourselves, to guide us in coding errors. We also use it for things like summarising and polishing up emails/docs.

[ASSISTANT]
In that recent example of the tool you built to guide coding errors, can you walk me through one specific time you used it? What parts did the tool handle, and what parts did you do yourself?

[USER]
It wasn't too long ago actually, we had a project going on, and we came across some bug that none of us had seen before, we asked the AI and it was able to break it down for me, which then allowed us to properly address it.

[ASSISTANT]
In that moment, who did the drafting and who did the reviewing? For example, did the AI propose the diagnosis and a code change that you then vetted, or did you write a fix and have the AI critique it?

[USER]
The AI pointed out the error, offered a couple of potential solutions, but once they had pin pointed the issue at hand, we knew what was needed.

[ASSISTANT]
When it pointed to the issue and suggested solutions, did it get anything wrong or partially off? If so, what did you do to check and correct it?

[USER]
As the AI model is still fairly new, and we're constantly working on it, it can make mistakes but in this case, there were no issues at all.

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind as you were using it on that bug—did it feel like a relief, or more like you still had to be on guard and double‑check everything?

[USER]
It's almost like a constant feel of security, because we know how much work we put into this AI model, and we know it's capabilities. We have a safety net to fall back on, if anything random happens and it has the ability to assist.

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned “we” a few times. How did using this tool change the way you and your teammates worked together on that bug—did it shift who spoke up, who took the lead, or who others turned to for help?

[USER]
This bug specifically, it was only me and one other member of my team, but they are all equally versed with this AI and know it's abilities, so when working, we are all doing so, not just the 2 of us who were working with this most recent bug. It gives the team a freedom to work and not be too scared to make a mistake.

[ASSISTANT]
When this tool helps you move faster on a bug, what do you usually do with the time you free up?

[USER]
Other jobs to do with the project, if that means replying to the investors emails or working on the AI code itself.

[ASSISTANT]
On the emails and docs you mentioned, how do you split the work with AI—who drafts, who reviews, and how do you handle it if the tone or details aren’t quite right?

[USER]
We have the AI always summarise and make drafts for us. We then review it, and once we've made alterations, we then run it through the AI once more.

[ASSISTANT]
When the AI drafts those messages and you’re reviewing them, what’s that experience like for you—does it feel like helpful support or more like tedious cleanup?

[USER]
No, it's a needed thing to do, we have trust in the AI, and more often than not, there isn't a lot of editing that needs to be done to them. As we work more with the AI, we become more aware of it's style and what to look out for, that me may want to change with it's writing.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
When dealing with investors/stake holders, we'd never give the AI that part of the job. We want it to still feel personal, and not like they are just being put over to an AI, because we can't be bothered to speak to them. That's something we will never change.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping those investor and stakeholder conversations personal so important to you?

[USER]
It creates a bond, on a personal level. We know each other, we speak on a personal level and I like to keep it like that. I typically do it face to face, or via Teams.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over more of those conversations, what do you think it would do to your relationships with those investors and your role on the team?

[USER]
I think we would lose touch to the stakeholders. It would feel like there's nothing in the job beyond the work itself. I like to put a face to a name and I know they do too.

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would give the AI all our debugging that is repetitive and just our routine code clean up, we tend to do at the end of the day

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those repetitive debugging and end‑of‑day cleanups the kind of work you’d gladly hand off?

[USER]
It's just a little boring and time consuming, it's something that isn't that important that we need a human to constantly check on it, and as I said before, we always go to the AI to help with the debugging if needed, anyway.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I think having the space to make decisions on how you approach your work, is really important and vital to keep in mind. You've been given a problem, and you have the choice to pick the required tools, how you structure it, and also the path you make to finding the solution without having someone hovering over you. It will also mean you will be trusted with important decisions, you are being trusted to manage your time efficiently, not being scared to ask for help when you realise you need it, and also to balance speed but keep that quality that is wanted and expected. Although we have AI and loads of new tools which assist us in a way that makes our job and lives a lot easier, autonomy is about keeping control over everything and all the key choices, which in turn is being able to be confident in the work you deliver.

[ASSISTANT]
That’s a thoughtful answer. Can you give me a concrete example from your recent work where you had that space to choose the tools and path, and what that looked like day to day?

[USER]
There was something not too long ago where I had to personally build a small internal tool to help clean up some old data which could be potentially damaged. My manager basically told me, there's an issue, and this is what I need from you, go do your best and get the job done. I was given free reign, basically. I got to pick what tech I wanted, I also tried a few different approaches, and I got to change things around when something didn't work how I wanted it to. Everyday I was organising my own work, like I would when I'm team leading my own actual team, but I was doing it for myself only for this. So, I knew I didn't have the pressure of someone coming in and disturbing me, watching over me, making sure I'm doing the right thing, which was a relief and actually made me able to work better.

[ASSISTANT]
That moment you mention of feeling relieved and able to work better really stands out. When you realized no one would be looking over your shoulder on that tool, what was your gut response, and how did it show up in the way you structured your day or made decisions?

[USER]
It's just an instant sense of relief, knowing I can do what I do best, and work without distractions. I'm someone who, if I'm being talked to while working, or being told what to do, or even just knowing someone is watching me from afar, I won't perform, and I'll maybe miss things I normally wouldn't. I'd be able to come into work, not have any stress thinking, I need to hurry up, they are waiting on me. I figured out what I needed to do for the day, work out my tasks and when I wanted to do them, it was pure control and I thrived under it.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for sharing all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is affecting your work or your team?

[USER]
I think over the last year or so, the AI has become part of the team, and it's something we don't rely on, but the fact that it's there as a safety net, has been such a relief and help to the entire team. It saves us a lot of time, which then allows us to work on other things on the project, or the AI itself. It hasn't and I don't see it ever replacing the teamwork we have within the team or the personal interactions we have with clients, but it's helped with how we approach out conversations with those people. We focus a lot more on the important tasks while the AI takes over from the boring parts, but also plays a vital role in the team.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for the thoughtful conversation and the concrete examples. I don’t have any further questions. Do you feel there’s anything important we haven’t covered about AI’s impact on your work?

If not, thank you very much for your answers!

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I'm an IT and admin manager for a solicitor's firm

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
The freedom to make changes to improve your work processes and efficiency, having open and honest colleagues who value you as a person, being able to have an effective work life balance

[ASSISTANT]
That’s helpful. When you say freedom to make changes, what kinds of changes do you have in mind, and how do you usually notice that something needs changing?

[USER]
I usually review procedures as I go along to see if I can improve them or make them more efficient, for example when rolling out new hardware or software.  I notice something needs changing if it is laborious and I can identify a more efficient way of doing it.

[ASSISTANT]
Got it. When you succeed in making one of those improvements, what tells you it was a good change — is it certain metrics, feedback from colleagues, or something else you pay attention to?

[USER]
I usually know myself if it has made the task better for me, but I also sometimes get feedback from colleagues if they notice the change

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use AI mainly to form ideas and structure my tasks and writing rather than explicitly do them for me.  It's a good starting point when I begin a new project to lay out all of the information and aims and see if I can improve anywhere

[ASSISTANT]
Can you tell me about a specific recent project where you used AI that way, and walk me through what you asked it for, what it produced, and what you did next?

[USER]
I was doing a hardware update across the company, specifically new PCs and laptops, and migrating our on premises servers to the cloud.  From the start I gave AI all the information and asked if it could come up with a good project management plan including when to do things and the most efficient way of managing the data etc.  I used this as a first draft to then make changes as I needed to and then begin the project once I was prepared.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did it effectively draft for you, and which parts did you create yourself from scratch?

[USER]
It drafted the overview of what new hardware was needed along with specifications and possible sources for purchasing.  I then took this information and did my own research, to then come to a decision on specifications and models etc.

[ASSISTANT]
Who handled the reviewing in that flow — did you treat the AI’s draft like a junior teammate’s work you had to verify, and did you find any mistakes or gaps when you did your own research? If so, what did you do with them?

[USER]
From my own knowledge I verified the information and confirmed anything I wasn't sure on with my own sources.  I suppose I did treat it similarly to a junior colleague who I trusted but needed to briefly verify

[ASSISTANT]
When you worked that way, what went through your mind about the quality of the draft — did it make the early phase feel lighter, or did it add a layer of checking that felt like extra work?

[USER]
From briefly looking over the data I could tell that it appeared to be accurate, so the planning phase felt like a lighter workload compared to producing this myself from scratch

[ASSISTANT]
When the planning felt lighter, what did you do with the time and energy you saved?

[USER]
I used it to accomplish other different jobs which are part of my workload, it removed some of the stress when working to deadlines

[ASSISTANT]
You mentioned it removed some of the stress when you were up against deadlines. What was your gut response to having that pressure ease up — more relief, more headspace to think, or something else?

[USER]
More relief mainly, and the confidence that I had enough time to do a really good job

[ASSISTANT]
Did using AI during that project change how you interacted with colleagues or managers at all, for example in how you shared plans or got sign-off?

[USER]
Not particularly, I used it as more of a tool for myself.  Once I had amended the draft I then got it signed off by management

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks, that makes sense. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I'd say probably responding to clients/suppliers directly in writing without my proofreading and amending language used.  I think it's quite obvious to the recipient when an email has been written entirely by AI

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping your own hand on those written responses important to you?

[USER]
It is a human connection and displays personality

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over more of that client and supplier writing, how do you think it would change how people relate to you in those exchanges or how they see your role on the team?

[USER]
I think people would notice the change and maybe change their opinion on the type of person or manager I am

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Procedural jobs such as sourcing supplies, organising my workflows etc

[ASSISTANT]
What makes those procedural jobs the ones you’d most like to hand off?

[USER]
Because they're more suited to AI's logical thinking and are fairly monotonous parts of my role

[ASSISTANT]
If AI handled those procedural pieces, do you think it would change how others see your contribution, or would it mainly free you up to focus on other strengths?

[USER]
I don't think others would necessarily know about it, so ideally wouldn't change how they see my contribution.  Even so I think they would understand

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
To have autonomy means being trusted in and given the tools to achieve and improve your own performance.  It means having the responsibility to manage yourself and identify improvements by your own volition.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your own work where you felt that trust and responsibility in a concrete way? What happened and how did you handle it?

[USER]
In 2020 the partners of my firm trusted me to come up with a policy for home working under tight time pressures when Covid hit.  They allowed me to procure hardware as needed and reported back to them once I had come up with an action plan

[ASSISTANT]
When you were given that mandate in 2020, what stands out to you about your first moves — how you gathered input, made decisions, and communicated back to the partners?

[USER]
The short timeframe made the initial planning more stressful and I would have benefited then having the AI resources I use today.  I think in future I'd be much more confident in my ability

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of this. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is impacting your work that we haven’t touched on? 

When you feel we’ve covered the important parts, I’ll share a short closing prompt.

[USER]
No I can't think of anything.  Thanks for the questions, they were interesting!

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. Do you feel there’s anything important we missed about how AI is affecting your work, or are we good to close?

--------------------

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
I work as a software developer for a small company that was just last year acquired by a much larger company. I have been working on a content calendar software called ContentCal that is now known as something different under the joint partnership with this new company. I also help run a small team of people who work on and around this project.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
I believe the core characteristics of a good job should always start with the environment you work in, and the people you work alongside. I believe that this should always be the building blocks that are the foundations of any good company\start-up in my case.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say the environment and the people, what makes those good in practice for you? For example, what does a healthy environment look like day to day?

[USER]
A healthy environment is a place where you can express yourself, and put whatever skills you have to the test on a daily basis. A place where you aren't judged on anything besides the work you do, and also a place where you feel comfortable providing a service on a daily basis.

[ASSISTANT]
That makes sense. Besides the environment and people, is there anything else you see as essential for a good job, like how work is structured, recognition, growth, or something else?

[USER]
I believe every job should have a form of progression for the people who work there. I like to think hard work pays off, and you can climb that ladder and make something of yourself. For this to happen the job\work you do needs a fair and orginised structure that can provide you with the means to progress.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI plays a HUGE role in what I and my team do on a daily basis. We work alongside AI and it helps us form the software that we've created. Without AI we wouldn't have this incredible opportunity to develop such a great piece of software.

[ASSISTANT]
When you say AI helps you form the software, can you walk me through one concrete task you or your team do with AI on a typical day? For instance, what’s a recent example where you used it and what happened step by step?

[USER]
We currently updated our software to a newer version. This needs to be run through an AI software that basically represents the user end of that software, so for example.. We needed to test a AI daily content generator, but we used a conflicting AI software to run that process, to see what outcome a real world scenario could achieve. We did this by setting up a AI version of a end user (someone who would use the software for online social media content) and then we used a different AI program that would test the abilities of our own software, and we ran this 1000's of times until we could be sure that our software was doing a good job and AI generation user end daily content posts at specific times, which is what the software is able to do.

[ASSISTANT]
In that testing setup, which parts did the AI handle and which parts did you or your team do yourselves? For example, who wrote the test scenarios and prompts, who ran the batches, and who reviewed the outputs?

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hi,  I do software development for work

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
The core characteristics of a good job are having work that is challenging enough that you can learn from it and gain experience. As well as having good colleagues and a positive & productive work environment

[ASSISTANT]
That makes sense. When you say challenging enough to learn from, what kind of challenge do you have in mind—technical puzzles, scope and ownership, deadlines, or something else?

[USER]
I would want the work to be technically challenging, scope

[ASSISTANT]
When you think about good colleagues and a positive, productive environment, what stands out as most important in day-to-day interactions?

[USER]
Colleagues that are friendly, helpful & knowledgeable

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
AI impacts my work by enabling me to shorten certain workflows & enables me to learn new things

[ASSISTANT]
Can you walk me through a recent example where you used AI to shorten a specific workflow—what was the task, and how did you use it step by step?

[USER]
A recent workflow was in a software development task. I asked AI to show me some ways to code this task. It showed me a new way of coding for this task, I implemented it and asked the AI to explain how the code works. I learnt from the approach that the AI showed me.

[ASSISTANT]
In that example, which parts did you do and which parts did the AI do—who drafted code, who reviewed it, and how did you handle any mistakes or mismatches you noticed?

[USER]
I already had an existing code base. The AI drafted the code for the task I gave it & I modified the code it generated to implement it into my existing code base.

[ASSISTANT]
What went through your mind as you were reviewing and modifying the AI’s code—did it feel like a productive way to use your expertise or more like tedious cleanup?

[USER]
When reviewing the AI's code I was thinking about the approach, how it worked & trying to understand it. It did feel productive as it saved me time from reseaching how to do it myself from scratch

[ASSISTANT]
When the AI’s approach didn’t quite fit your codebase, did you run into any errors or odd behaviors, and if so, how did you go about diagnosing and fixing them?

[USER]
I gave the AI more context & snippets from my codebase so it gave me a revised version of it's code. I then used that revision and made the necessary changes to implement it

[ASSISTANT]
When you went back and forth with those revisions, what was your gut response—more like relief that it was guiding you, or more like frustration at having to babysit it?

[USER]
More relief, that it was understanding and helpful

[ASSISTANT]
Did anyone else see the code that came out of this process, like a teammate in a review, and how did that interaction go?

[USER]
No one has reviewed the code yet

[ASSISTANT]
Since it saved you time, what did you do with that time you didn’t spend researching or drafting from scratch?

[USER]
That time saving enabled me to work on other tasks

[ASSISTANT]
Can you think of another time when you or a colleague used AI in a way that affected how your team works together? What happened?

[USER]
My colleagues use AI in a similar way so we benefit in similar ways such as time savings. But we still engage with each other in terms of helping each other and sharing knowledge.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
I wouldn't want to hand over the role of full software development to AI, because I would be out of a job as a result

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping full software development in your hands important to you beyond job security—what do you get from doing the work yourself?

[USER]
It is fulfilling to do this work myself and enables me to learn and grow in my career

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over full development, how do you think it would change your role on the team or your relationships with teammates?

[USER]
I would be reduced to simpler roles such as testing. It would potentially make my relationship with teammates less interactive

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
I would happily give the job of documentation to AI as it can be tedious and boring

[ASSISTANT]
What makes documentation feel tedious for you, and if AI handled it, how would that change how others see your contribution to the team?

[USER]
It requires alot of time and reviewing alot of code. If AI handled it, it would be able to review code much quicker and therefore generate documentation much quicker too. I don't really think it would change how others see my contribution to the team as they have similar feelings about documentation and as long as the documentation is informative and easy to read, it is okay.

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
I would tell them that having autonomy in my job today means being able to take your own approach to your tasks.

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from your own work of taking your own approach—what was the task, and what choices did you make that felt like they were truly yours?

[USER]
An example of taking my own approach in my own work is in the task I described earlier. Having to implement a feature, doing your own research or using AI to come up with an efficient solution if you think that existing methods can be improved upon.

[ASSISTANT]
When you decided to try the AI’s approach instead of sticking with existing methods, what made you confident enough to go that route—was it past experience, tests you ran, feedback from metrics, or something else you relied on?

[USER]
It was through running my own tests & researching about the approach to see its uses & effectiveness for this application.

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for walking me through all of that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to add about how AI is impacting your work that we haven’t covered? If not, I’ll close with a short rating question.

[USER]
Nothing further to add

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. Before we finish, is there anything else you’d like to share about AI’s impact on your work?

If not: Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hello, I do web design

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for that. In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Providing value, taking care of the customer and ensuring their needs are met

[ASSISTANT]
When you say providing value, what does that look like in practice in your world?

[USER]
I put the same effort into my work that larger companies would, but for less cost as i'm leaner as a freelancer

[ASSISTANT]
Got it. When you say taking care of the customer and ensuring their needs are met, what do you pay attention to day to day to make that happen?

[USER]
Any questions, concerns or ideas they might have about their website i'm creating that I will help guide them with

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Can you now please tell me about how AI impacts your work?

[USER]
I use AI a lot for research, design ideas/inspiration, learn about different business sectors and to cover skills i don't have as much experience in, like copywriting on a topic i have little knowledge of

[ASSISTANT]
That’s helpful. Can you walk me through one recent project where you used AI for copywriting on an unfamiliar topic? What was the task, and how did you and the AI split the work?

[USER]
I was working on a website for a therapist, whom asked me to provide the content for their site. I didn't know much about therapy and such, so I employed AI to help me understand and lay out a structure that i then fine-tuned and made more appopriate

[ASSISTANT]
In that therapist project, who did the first draft of the actual page text, and who handled the reviewing and revisions?

[USER]
I did the first draft and then together with the client we reviewed it to ensure it was okay.

[ASSISTANT]
When you were drafting and then reviewing it with the client, what stood out to you about using AI in that process — did it feel like a boost, a crutch, or something else?

[USER]
While not perfect, it definitely helped and saved me a lot of time researching about the topic, so a boost.

[ASSISTANT]
When it saved you that research time, what did you end up doing with the time you got back on that project?

[USER]
I could focus more on the design which i'm most skilled at rather than things im not, copywriting.

[ASSISTANT]
Makes sense. In that copy, did the AI make any mistakes or include anything that didn’t land quite right for a therapist’s audience, and if so, how did you handle it?

[USER]
Yes,with client help i was able to fine-tune it to be suitable for the clients needs

[ASSISTANT]
When you and the client were fine-tuning those parts, what went through your mind — did it feel like you were applying your judgment in a good way, or more like tedious cleanup work?

[USER]
It was tedious but necessary to ensure the copywrite was fit for purpose

[ASSISTANT]
How did using AI for that copy change your interactions with the client, if at all? For example, did it affect how you two reviewed drafts or who was seen as the expert in the content?

[USER]
It helped me understand a bit about the topic, that i would otherwise have to consult my client on and waste precious time

[ASSISTANT]
Can you think of another recent task where you brought AI into your process, maybe for research or design inspiration? What happened there, and how did you and the AI divide the work?

[USER]
I'm redesigning my own site and used AI to help me get an idea of my ideal customer and how to  market to them in the design

[ASSISTANT]
In that work on your own site, what did the AI actually produce for you — a written profile, messaging pillars, layout ideas — and what parts did you create or decide yourself?

[USER]
User persona's and layout ideas

[ASSISTANT]
When you saw those personas and layout ideas, what was your gut response — did they click right away or did you feel you had to push back and reshape them a lot?

[USER]
They needed reshaping, but i expected that.

[ASSISTANT]
What parts did you reshape the most, and what guided your decisions as you adjusted them?

[USER]
the core demographic of the persona and my own logic and instinct

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you. Thinking about the future: Is there any aspect of your job that you would never want to hand over to an AI, even if the AI could do it perfectly?

[USER]
That's a tough question to answer off the top of my head!

[ASSISTANT]
No problem. Take a moment and think about the parts of your work you enjoy most or feel are most defining — what’s one piece you’d be reluctant to give up?

[USER]
the creativity aspect, i don't think AI will ever be able to create designs like a human can.

[ASSISTANT]
Why is keeping that creativity in your hands important to you?

[USER]
The design is what connects and communicates to the viewer, if it were artificial it destroys trust and respect.

[ASSISTANT]
If an AI took over more of the creative work, how do you think that would change how clients relate to you or how they see your role on a project?

[USER]
They'd probably think it replaces designers like me, which would end up being disastrous for accessiblity and following standards

[ASSISTANT]
On the flip side, what is a part of your job you would happily give to AI tomorrow?

[USER]
Communicating with the client, allowing it to get all the information from them and then process it to me in a way that is easier for me to work with

[ASSISTANT]
What makes you eager to hand off that client communication — is it the time it takes, the back-and-forth, or something else?

[USER]
Communication isn't my strongest point as a neurodiverse person, so it takes a lot of effort on my side

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. If an AI handled more of the client communication, what would you want it to do exactly — gather requirements, schedule and summarize calls, translate client language into clear design briefs — and what would you still want to keep doing yourself?

[USER]
gather requirements, handle queries and generate design briefs and copywrite. but i'd still want creative control

[ASSISTANT]
We’ve talked about your specific experiences. To close, I have a broad question. If a young person entering your field asked you what it means to have autonomy in your job today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
Could you rephrase that question?

[ASSISTANT]
Sure. If a junior designer asked you what it means to have real control over how you do your work today, what would you tell them?

[USER]
It means to be the final decision maker on everything you do and not let AI dictate or lead

[ASSISTANT]
Can you give me an example from a recent project where you were the final decision maker and didn’t let AI lead? What did that look like in the moment?

[USER]
I don't have an example of that unfortunately

[ASSISTANT]
No worries. Thinking more generally, when you say being the final decision maker, what kinds of decisions do you mean — picking the visual direction, choosing content tone, setting the structure, or something else?

[USER]
visual direction, how it relates to the user, how it feels, how accessible it is etc

[ASSISTANT]
That helps. Can you share a small moment from your own site redesign when you decided on the visual direction or the feel, even if AI had suggested something different? What did you choose and why?

[USER]
I believe i have a greater understanding of general design guidelines and accessiblity, so i always go with my own instinct, I use ai for ideation

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks, that’s clear. 

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about AI’s impact on your work that you think we haven’t touched on but should?

[USER]
Not off the top of my head

[ASSISTANT]
Thank you for your time and insights. Do you feel there’s anything important you want to add later, or are you happy to leave it here for now? 

Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize how experience of AI is changing and might change your work: 1 (it describes poorly how AI might change my work), 2 (it partially describes how AI might change my work), 3 (it describes well how AI might change my work), 4 (it describes very well how AI might change my work).

[ASSISTANT]
Hello! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about AI and its impact on your work today. Could you start off by telling me about what you do for work?

[USER]
Hello, I do website design and related services for work.

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks for sharing that. In your view, what are the core characteristics of a good job, in general, not necessarily your job?

[USER]
Attention to detail, delivering on time and providing good value to the customer

[ASSISTANT]
Thanks. When you think of attention to detail, what does that look like in your day-to-day work? Can you give me an example that sticks with you?

[USER]
I take great effort to look at the needs of the customer and do my own research into what they do, their competitors and market and get an understanding of what they do and why.

[ASSISTANT]
That makes sense. Can you walk me through a recent project where you did that research—what steps did you take, and how did it shape the final design?
